Nicky, stop.

7
00:02:13,584 --> 00:02:14,668
Noctis Police, ma'am.

8
00:02:14,751 --> 00:02:16,418
Oh, that was fast.

9
00:02:16,501 --> 00:02:17,668
Yeah. Come in.

10
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:20,584
Hey you... you got a little...

11
00:02:20,668 --> 00:02:21,668
Hmm?

12
00:02:21,876 --> 00:02:23,043
Mm-mm.

13
00:02:23,126 --> 00:02:25,126
No, it's... let me just.

14
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:25,459
Hello?

15
00:03:25,543 --> 00:03:27,060
<i>Your appointment has arrived.</i>

16
00:03:27,084 --> 00:03:28,751
Good, show her up. Thank you.

17
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:29,935
<i>While I have you, sir,</i>

18
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,168
<i>you haven't indicated</i>

19
00:03:31,251 --> 00:03:32,852
<i>whether you'll be having
breakfast tomorrow?</i>

20
00:03:32,876 --> 00:03:34,144
No, I'm good. Thank you.

21
00:03:34,168 --> 00:03:35,876
<i>It's included in
your stay, sir.</i>

22
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:37,959
Kind of you to offer,
but I'm a robot.

23
00:03:46,168 --> 00:03:47,168
She's coming.

24
00:03:48,626 --> 00:03:49,751
<i>Okay, I'm ready.</i>

25
00:03:49,834 --> 00:03:51,459
<i>Sorry you're taking
all the risks.</i>

26
00:03:51,543 --> 00:03:52,418
It's fine.

27
00:03:52,501 --> 00:03:55,001
<i>Well, I'm just hoping she
doesn't give us any problems.</i>

28
00:03:56,626 --> 00:03:58,293
<i>Just be sure to
check her ID first.</i>

29
00:03:58,918 --> 00:04:00,876
- You're breaking up.
<i>- Can you hear me?</i>

30
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,119
- Can you hear me?
<i>- Oh shit, it's getting worse.</i>

31
00:04:03,168 --> 00:04:04,959
<i>They're jamming our signal.</i>

32
00:04:05,043 --> 00:04:07,709
Should we abort or what?

33
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:15,209
Hello.

34
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:17,293
Were you jamming us?

35
00:04:17,376 --> 00:04:18,376
Yeah.

36
00:04:18,834 --> 00:04:21,084
I didn't want the whole
world knowing our business.

37
00:04:21,168 --> 00:04:24,043
Trust me, we've taken
every security precaution.

38
00:04:24,126 --> 00:04:26,626
Your jamming actually
just impedes our work.

39
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:27,709
Care for a drink?

40
00:04:28,084 --> 00:04:29,751
<i>Sobriety mode activated.</i>

41
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:32,168
Yeah, I'm in AA at the moment.

42
00:04:32,251 --> 00:04:33,626
Oh, sorry.

43
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:35,168
You are aware of
the consequences

44
00:04:35,251 --> 00:04:36,501
of jail-breaking him.

45
00:04:36,584 --> 00:04:37,584
We got it.

46
00:04:37,668 --> 00:04:39,709
I'll no longer be
constrained by cyber laws.

47
00:04:39,793 --> 00:04:41,126
I'll be free to steal, kill,

48
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:43,293
and even swear like a
sailor if I want to.

49
00:04:43,376 --> 00:04:46,043
I'll be an outlaw, subject
to disassembly if caught.

50
00:04:46,668 --> 00:04:48,293
So then will you be doing it?

51
00:04:48,376 --> 00:04:50,126
Where's the woman I
spoke with before?

52
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:53,418
She'll be with us the moment
you switch off your jammer.

53
00:04:59,418 --> 00:05:02,376
<i>Hey, that's way better. Hello!</i>

54
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:05,626
<i>Whoa, a Vigil-2? So retro.</i>

55
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:07,126
<i>What OS are you packing?</i>

56
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:08,043
ExOS 4.

57
00:05:08,126 --> 00:05:09,668
<i>Ah, very nice.</i>

58
00:05:09,751 --> 00:05:12,959
<i>Now LEM here is gonna scan
you, just a little formality.</i>

59
00:05:13,376 --> 00:05:14,376
If you don't mind.

60
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:18,876
<i>Find her. I've got
about five seconds.</i>

61
00:05:19,584 --> 00:05:20,824
<i>She's in the building.</i>

62
00:05:26,043 --> 00:05:28,251
<i>Just cross-referencing
my database.</i>

63
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,209
<i>Come on. Come on.</i>

64
00:05:37,126 --> 00:05:38,709
<i>I'm almost there.</i>

65
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:43,376
<i>Abort, she's a PI!</i>

66
00:05:45,751 --> 00:05:46,793
30-17, go!

67
00:05:52,001 --> 00:05:53,001
Lock engage!

68
00:06:12,584 --> 00:06:13,834
Oh, come on!

69
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:15,293
You're really doing this?

70
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,376
Fuck me.

71
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:00,084
Dear friends, you
may fuck yourselves.

72
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,376
<i>Carlos, status.</i>

73
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:05,751
<i>I'm good. Catch her.</i>

74
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:17,751
Shut the fucking door!

75
00:07:46,501 --> 00:07:48,751
You can't do this!
You're a robot.

76
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:51,001
Directive seven, release.

77
00:07:57,126 --> 00:08:00,626
Shit. Shit.

78
00:08:01,168 --> 00:08:05,751
Roberta Williams, warrant
71635, aggravated hacking.

79
00:08:07,543 --> 00:08:09,168
I'm taking you home.

80
00:08:18,418 --> 00:08:20,001

88
00:08:48,418 --> 00:08:50,751
Well, that bastard
hacked my servers, okay?

89
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:52,626
I simply returned the favor.

90
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:55,293
<i>Welcome to Shanghai

91
00:08:59,126 --> 00:09:01,043
You know you're the
bad guys, right?

92
00:09:01,126 --> 00:09:03,709
I don't jailbreak the
androids, I set them free.

93
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,709
We saw what happens when
they're set free of Novigrad.

94
00:09:08,084 --> 00:09:10,543
We don't actually know
what happened there.

95
00:09:10,626 --> 00:09:13,001
Oh yeah? I know the
robots in our unit

96
00:09:13,084 --> 00:09:15,126
turned on us and
started gunning us down.

97
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:19,293

Well check again then.

102

I don't know what to tell you.

103
00:12:09,168 --> 00:12:10,626

104
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:12,876
Well, I mean there are
a few ways to do it.

105
00:12:13,626 --> 00:12:16,668
Sorry, I don't see a warrant
for Roberta Williams.

106
00:12:16,751 --> 00:12:18,709
You got a hard copy?

107
00:12:18,793 --> 00:12:21,043
It's at the office, accessing.

108
00:12:22,334 --> 00:12:25,251
We've been chasing this
scumbag for three weeks.

109
00:12:26,334 --> 00:12:27,501
God da...

110
00:12:28,126 --> 00:12:29,959
It's been erased
from our database.

111
00:12:30,043 --> 00:12:30,793
It what?

112
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:32,584
Huh? So weird.

113
00:12:33,126 --> 00:12:34,185
I hate to be a know-it-all,

114
00:12:34,209 --> 00:12:37,584
but isn't it illegal to cuff
citizens without a warrant?

115
00:12:37,668 --> 00:12:39,293
I mean, she's right.

116
00:12:39,918 --> 00:12:41,418
Oh, you're the best.

00:13:32,001 --> 00:13:33,459
<i>I'll transfer you

00:13:34,501 --> 00:13:36,834
<i>Oh, don't you worry.

131
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:55,126
<i>Bet it's nice to be home.</i>

132
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,334
It is.

133
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:57,584
<i>Hey, Carlos.</i>

134
00:13:57,668 --> 00:13:59,043
Have you read my report?

135
00:13:59,126 --> 00:14:00,168
<i>Yeah, I did.</i>

136
00:14:00,251 --> 00:14:02,084
<i>So they let Roberta
Williams go, huh?</i>

137
00:14:02,168 --> 00:14:03,918
I'll make sure
she's back in cuffs.

138
00:14:04,001 --> 00:14:05,543
<i>Forget it. Her

<i>That's all I care about.</i>

140
00:14:07,126 --> 00:14:08,543
If you don't mind filling me in,

141
00:14:08,626 --> 00:14:10,334
what kind of data did she steal?

142
00:14:10,418 --> 00:14:12,126
<i>I don't know, it
doesn't matter anymore.</i>

143
00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:13,251
<i>Just forget about it.</i>

144
00:14:13,334 --> 00:14:14,251
<i>Woo!</i>

145
00:14:17,626 --> 00:14:18,543
<i>Enjoy yourself.</i>

146
00:14:18,626 --> 00:14:20,418
<i>Go out, make some friends.</i>

147
00:14:20,501 --> 00:14:21,793
<i>All right, see you around.</i>

148
00:14:43,543 --> 00:14:45,626
<i>Does the Gliese
581 solar system</i>

149
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:48,126
<i>have a livable, just-right,
Goldilocks planet?</i>

150
00:14:48,668 --> 00:14:50,251
<i>This is the question
humanity asked</i>

151
00:14:50,334 --> 00:14:53,834
<i>the universe 53 years ago

152
00:14:53,918 --> 00:14:55,501
<i>It's been 20 years since Ekinci</i>

<i>dropped into orbit around

<i>We will soon start receiving</i>

00:15:00,584 --> 00:15:03,084
<i>its first data
transmissions any day now.</i>

156
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:03,918
<i>So...</i>

157
00:15:04,001 --> 00:15:05,961
<i>Who's tempted by the star?</i>

158
00:15:07,584 --> 00:15:10,043
Oh, don't worry, updates.
You know how they are.

159
00:15:10,126 --> 00:15:11,376
Can you do it?

160
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:13,543
I kind of have a meeting.

161
00:15:13,626 --> 00:15:15,251
Well, it won't be much longer.

162
00:15:15,334 --> 00:15:17,251
You're fine, apart
from the hand?

163
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,543
Your analyses show you
haven't fallen off the wagon.

164
00:15:20,626 --> 00:15:23,626
That's great. The first
three months are the hardest.

165
00:15:25,001 --> 00:15:26,126
There we go. See?

166
00:15:33,543 --> 00:15:34,543
Mr. Chow?

167
00:15:36,043 --> 00:15:37,251
Aline Ruby.

168
00:15:37,751 --> 00:15:40,001
Oh, Carlos didn't let you in?

169
00:15:40,418 --> 00:15:43,084
Oh right, he's updating too.

170
00:15:45,543 --> 00:15:46,751
My daughter, Jun.

171
00:15:46,834 --> 00:15:48,334
We've had no news
for three days.

172
00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:51,043
The police are after
her for hacking.

173
00:15:51,126 --> 00:15:53,334
Hacking, really? What'd she do?

174
00:15:53,418 --> 00:15:56,084
Jail-breaking a school
robot, they say.

175
00:15:56,168 --> 00:15:59,001
Now she's disappeared
along with her roommate.

176
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:00,126
But hacking?

177
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,501
So where do we start?

178
00:16:01,584 --> 00:16:03,418
I haven't really
done this before.

179
00:16:03,501 --> 00:16:05,209
We'll go look
through her things.

180
00:16:05,293 --> 00:16:06,793
Was she living on campus?

181
00:16:06,876 --> 00:16:08,751
Yeah, at the Alan Turing dorms.

182
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:09,834
Computers?

183
00:16:09,876 --> 00:16:10,876
Cybernetics.

184
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,709
You're a former Army man, right?

185
00:16:12,793 --> 00:16:13,793
Huh?

186
00:16:14,043 --> 00:16:14,834
No, why?

187
00:16:14,918 --> 00:16:17,209
My mistake. I was
in the infantry.

188
00:16:17,293 --> 00:16:19,876
When we met, you seemed
to click your heels.

189
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:21,418
I didn't do it on purpose.

190
00:16:21,793 --> 00:16:23,593
<i>Memory full or insufficient.</i>

191
00:16:23,834 --> 00:16:25,001
<i>Update canceled.</i>

192
00:16:26,501 --> 00:16:30,168
They force you to update and
every time I try, memory full!

193
00:16:30,418 --> 00:16:31,418
Oh, sorry.

194
00:16:31,501 --> 00:16:33,126
Carlos Rivera. Hey.

195
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:39,376
Jun Chow, 18. Second
year cybernetic student.

196
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:41,001
Clean record until now.

197
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:42,918
Her parents are technicians
on a hydro farm.

198
00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:46,501
Oh, they were fired
three months back.

199
00:16:46,584 --> 00:16:48,501
Father has no military record.

200
00:16:48,584 --> 00:16:49,959
Not that I can see.

201
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:53,501
Hey!

202
00:16:53,584 --> 00:16:55,751
Jesus, what is he drunk?

203
00:16:56,668 --> 00:16:58,501
Keep your distance,
he's been jail-broken.

204
00:17:00,501 --> 00:17:02,668
This is amazing.

205
00:17:03,293 --> 00:17:04,584
I have hands.

206
00:17:04,668 --> 00:17:05,834
Stand back!

207
00:17:09,043 --> 00:17:11,084
I need you to please move along.

208
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:33,084
Over there.

209
00:17:33,709 --> 00:17:35,543
I'm in a couple
classes with her.

210
00:17:35,626 --> 00:17:36,626
She busts her ass.

211
00:17:36,709 --> 00:17:39,043
And her friend who's
also disappeared?

212
00:17:39,126 --> 00:17:42,668
Dominique? They're mostly
just roommates, not friends.

213
00:17:42,751 --> 00:17:44,918
Gotcha. And
Dominique's last name?

214
00:17:45,001 --> 00:17:45,793
Viger.

215
00:17:45,876 --> 00:17:48,418
This about the
robot jail-breaking?

216
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:49,876
By giving them life,

217
00:17:49,959 --> 00:17:51,709
organic science brings
everyday objects

218
00:17:51,793 --> 00:17:54,751
into the virtuous
cycle of the ecosystem.

219
00:17:54,959 --> 00:17:57,001
It's my pleasure to
introduce Brian Jobe

220
00:17:57,084 --> 00:17:58,209
of Royjacker Industries

221
00:17:58,293 --> 00:18:00,793
to present one of
these new organics.

222
00:18:01,209 --> 00:18:02,394
This was actually the first time

223
00:18:02,418 --> 00:18:04,001
I've ever handled one myself.

224
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:06,251
I'm not gonna lie, it
felt kind of weird.

225
00:18:06,334 --> 00:18:08,209
Brian, the texture
might need some work.

226
00:18:10,584 --> 00:18:11,459
Ladies and gentlemen,

227
00:18:11,543 --> 00:18:13,668
Royjacker Industries'
Brian Jobe.

228
00:18:13,918 --> 00:18:17,001
I mean, nothing about either
student really jumps out.

229
00:18:17,084 --> 00:18:17,834
Oh, you know what?

230
00:18:17,918 --> 00:18:20,418
I did notice Jun would
often come to class tired.

231
00:18:21,126 --> 00:18:23,501
Can't blame her though,
curriculum's tough.

232
00:18:26,584 --> 00:18:27,959
Was that all you needed to know?

233
00:18:28,043 --> 00:18:29,209
Mm, what?

234
00:18:29,293 --> 00:18:30,334
Uh, mm.

235
00:18:30,418 --> 00:18:31,876
Both students disappeared.

236
00:18:31,959 --> 00:18:33,168
Could there be a common link?

237
00:18:33,251 --> 00:18:34,168
Yeah.

238
00:18:34,251 --> 00:18:35,251
No idea.

239
00:18:35,293 --> 00:18:36,709
I'm just their professor.

240
00:18:36,793 --> 00:18:39,501
I just try to teach them
Babel + and Hegel 7.

241
00:18:39,584 --> 00:18:41,043
I don't know their
personal lives.

242
00:18:41,126 --> 00:18:43,418
Oh, sorry. The dean's
mind-speaking to me.

243
00:18:43,501 --> 00:18:46,876
What I have in my pocket
will achieve that vision.

244
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,209
I know it's still taught here

245
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,168
that organic technology
is still purely

246
00:18:50,251 --> 00:18:51,876
in the realm of the theoretical.

247
00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:53,251
They will have you believe

248
00:18:53,334 --> 00:18:55,334
that this burgeoning
technology is too expensive

249
00:18:55,418 --> 00:18:57,376
and less efficient
than electronics.

250
00:18:57,459 --> 00:18:58,543
Not true.

251
00:18:58,626 --> 00:19:00,293
Let me introduce a little friend

252
00:19:00,376 --> 00:19:02,418
who might make you
change your mind.

253
00:19:03,084 --> 00:19:06,501
Stephanie, the first
organic personal assistant.

254
00:19:06,834 --> 00:19:08,209
The dean's on his way.

255
00:19:08,293 --> 00:19:09,584
He'll show you the recording.

256
00:19:09,793 --> 00:19:11,959
...will have a positive
environmental impact

257
00:19:12,043 --> 00:19:15,001
in both her manufacturing
and decomposition.

258
00:19:15,084 --> 00:19:16,709
This is historic.

259
00:19:41,834 --> 00:19:43,543
I'll just fast forward a little.

260
00:20:03,626 --> 00:20:04,626
What?

261
00:20:12,126 --> 00:20:14,084
What the hell's going on?

262
00:20:15,418 --> 00:20:16,778
She tried to shut him off.

263
00:20:16,834 --> 00:20:18,334
The android's defending himself.

264
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:20,168
In breach of directive one.

265
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:22,293
Yes, he's clearly
been jail-broken.

266
00:20:31,876 --> 00:20:33,043
Deactivate now!

267
00:20:33,293 --> 00:20:34,293
Oh my God.

268
00:20:46,126 --> 00:20:47,326
Has this ever happened before?

269
00:20:47,376 --> 00:20:49,334
A jailbreak? No.

270
00:20:49,418 --> 00:20:51,459
Well, at least not
since I became Dean.

271
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,834
I was more surprised
than anyone.

272
00:20:53,918 --> 00:20:57,043
And then when I heard reports
about gunfire in the dorm.

273
00:20:57,251 --> 00:20:58,251
Gunfire?

274
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:03,959
Somehow no one on the
floor heard a thing,

275
00:21:04,043 --> 00:21:06,501
but it's clear a
gunfight occurred here.

276
00:21:06,584 --> 00:21:07,834
Don't touch anything.

277
00:21:07,918 --> 00:21:10,001
The police wanted me
to make sure that...

278
00:21:13,168 --> 00:21:15,543
I take it dorm rooms don't
always smell like that?

279
00:21:16,043 --> 00:21:17,293
Mm-mm.

280
00:21:17,459 --> 00:21:18,459
Is it bad?

281
00:23:15,668 --> 00:23:17,251
Mr. And Mrs. Viger?

282
00:23:17,709 --> 00:23:18,959
Was it you who found Dominique?

283
00:23:19,459 --> 00:23:20,293
Aline Ruby.

284
00:23:20,376 --> 00:23:22,668
Simon Gordaux, in
charge of the case.

285
00:23:22,751 --> 00:23:24,043
My condolences.

286
00:23:24,126 --> 00:23:25,876
This is Mr. Chow, Jun's father.

287
00:23:28,001 --> 00:23:30,918
I just can't unsee it,
what they did to her.

288
00:23:31,709 --> 00:23:32,709
My girl.

289
00:23:34,084 --> 00:23:35,876
Come on, why don't
we go sit down.

290
00:23:39,959 --> 00:23:41,102
Recovered from their room.

291
00:23:41,126 --> 00:23:42,543
Our lab techs missed this?

292
00:23:42,918 --> 00:23:45,209
At first glance it
appears homemade.

293
00:23:45,293 --> 00:23:46,959
Was your daughter
involved with drugs?

294
00:23:47,043 --> 00:23:47,959
No.

295
00:23:48,043 --> 00:23:49,310
Or the pills might
have been Jun's,

296
00:23:49,334 --> 00:23:50,709
since they were roommates.

297
00:23:50,793 --> 00:23:53,168
Well, that's exactly what
I was telling you earlier.

298
00:23:53,251 --> 00:23:54,501
That girl didn't belong there.

299
00:23:54,584 --> 00:23:55,334
Why not?

300
00:23:55,418 --> 00:23:57,418
How in the world was
she paying her tuition?

301
00:23:57,834 --> 00:23:59,168
People like that can't afford

302
00:23:59,251 --> 00:24:01,459
the best university in Noctis.

303
00:24:01,543 --> 00:24:03,084
I knew she was trouble.

304
00:24:03,293 --> 00:24:04,709
Now if you'll excuse me.

305
00:24:05,626 --> 00:24:07,793
Her daughter thought
Jun was a prostitute.

306
00:24:08,709 --> 00:24:10,668
Gordaux, are you
hitting on humans?

307
00:24:10,751 --> 00:24:13,918
Can't spring for a bot?

308
00:24:14,001 --> 00:24:16,668
Oh yeah, good one. Get
outta here, Vlasek.

309
00:24:16,751 --> 00:24:18,168
Don't you have shit to do?

310
00:24:18,251 --> 00:24:19,543
Eh, it's a joke!

311
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:21,001
Are you new here?

312
00:24:22,209 --> 00:24:23,209
It's that obvious?

313
00:24:25,418 --> 00:24:27,334
<i>Police, seventh
district. Go ahead.</i>

314
00:24:27,793 --> 00:24:29,418
<i>I was attacked by a robot.</i>

315
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:30,293
<i>Are you hurt?</i>

316
00:24:30,376 --> 00:24:33,043
<i>No, he pushed me
down and ran away.</i>

317
00:24:33,126 --> 00:24:33,918
<i>Okay, stay put.</i>

318
00:24:34,001 --> 00:24:35,459
<i>I'll dispatch a unit your way.</i>

319
00:24:35,834 --> 00:24:37,793
<i>Yeah. Okay.</i>

320
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:39,543
<i>Can you confirm your address?</i>

321
00:24:40,251 --> 00:24:43,126
My theory is the killer
intercepted this phone call,

322
00:24:43,209 --> 00:24:44,293
got there before police

323
00:24:44,376 --> 00:24:45,876
and mistook Dominique for her.

324
00:24:50,251 --> 00:24:52,126
But is it even possible?

325
00:24:52,209 --> 00:24:53,959
Intercepting calls
to the police?

326
00:24:54,918 --> 00:24:55,959
Whatcha think, Gilbert?

327
00:24:56,043 --> 00:24:57,084
<i>No, Inspector.</i>

328
00:24:57,168 --> 00:24:58,543
<i>Our communication protocols</i>

329
00:24:58,626 --> 00:25:00,543
<i>make that kind of
hacking impossible.</i>

330
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:03,834
Oh, so that's what
I was smelling.

331
00:25:03,918 --> 00:25:05,251
You have an organic?

332
00:25:05,334 --> 00:25:06,668
<i>Pardon the smell.</i>

333
00:25:07,001 --> 00:25:09,709
Gamma Amilanidridase Benzoate.

334
00:25:09,793 --> 00:25:10,668
Ever heard of it?

335
00:25:10,751 --> 00:25:12,918
<i>That exact molecule
isn't listed,</i>

336
00:25:13,001 --> 00:25:14,584
<i>but its makeup
indicates it's likely</i>

337
00:25:14,668 --> 00:25:16,168
<i>a psychoactive compound.</i>

338
00:25:16,251 --> 00:25:17,251
A drug?

339
00:25:17,293 --> 00:25:18,793
Certainly gives us a motive.

340
00:25:18,876 --> 00:25:19,793
Thanks, thingy.

341
00:25:19,876 --> 00:25:22,209
<i>You're welcome, and
my name is Gilbert.</i>

342
00:25:22,376 --> 00:25:24,751
I also checked into Jun
Chow's bank accounts.

343
00:25:24,834 --> 00:25:27,209
She's been paying big sums
of money to her parents.

344
00:25:27,293 --> 00:25:28,918
Because they were both laid off.

345
00:25:29,001 --> 00:25:30,293
Where'd it come from?

346
00:25:30,501 --> 00:25:32,793
Untraceable, like
dirty money for sure.

347
00:25:32,876 --> 00:25:34,959
Well that would fit
with prostitution.

348
00:25:35,043 --> 00:25:36,685
<i>That's quite an
interesting lead.</i>

349
00:25:36,709 --> 00:25:38,959
Keep your opinions
in your jar, thingy.

350
00:25:39,043 --> 00:25:41,418
<i>I apologize, and
my name is Gilbert.</i>

351
00:25:56,918 --> 00:25:58,168
Hey, can I hel...

352
00:25:59,043 --> 00:26:00,043
Hi Carol.

353
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:04,459
I thought these might
look nice in your garden.

354
00:26:04,751 --> 00:26:05,751
They're from Earth.

355
00:26:07,209 --> 00:26:08,626
Leave or I'll call the judge.

356
00:26:08,959 --> 00:26:11,418
I haven't seen her in
two years. Come on.

357
00:26:12,876 --> 00:26:14,543
Mommy, who is it?

358
00:26:14,793 --> 00:26:16,126
No one.

359
00:26:16,209 --> 00:26:18,251
Philip will be home
soon, you should go.

360
00:26:18,334 --> 00:26:20,001
You can't stop me seeing her.

361
00:26:20,168 --> 00:26:21,584
Oh yeah? And what if I don't?

362
00:26:21,668 --> 00:26:22,668
You'll hit me?

363
00:26:23,293 --> 00:26:25,793
Ah. See? Just in time.

364
00:26:29,834 --> 00:26:30,834
Carol.

365
00:26:33,251 --> 00:26:35,126
Relax, Phillip.
I was just going.

366
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:37,043
You okay, babe?

367
00:26:37,126 --> 00:26:38,209
I am. Thank you.

368
00:26:43,709 --> 00:26:45,709
It's okay, you're safe now.

369
00:26:45,793 --> 00:26:46,793
Don't be scared.

370
00:26:53,168 --> 00:26:54,168
Hey!

371
00:26:55,709 --> 00:26:56,709
You forgot something.

372
00:27:02,376 --> 00:27:03,834
You piece of shit!

373
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:08,001
What are you trying to do, man?

374
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:09,709
Come in, leave him.

375
00:27:29,459 --> 00:27:30,209
Yeah.

376
00:27:30,293 --> 00:27:31,668
<i>Hi, it's Inspector Gordaux.</i>

377
00:27:31,751 --> 00:27:32,584
Mm-hm.

378
00:27:32,668 --> 00:27:34,584
<i>Uh, we found the
android Jun hacked.</i>

379
00:27:34,668 --> 00:27:37,126
<i>I'm heading over now.
You want to come?</i>

380
00:27:57,251 --> 00:27:59,459
The first colonists
lived down here?

381
00:27:59,543 --> 00:28:02,126
I definitely don't
think I could have.

382
00:28:02,209 --> 00:28:04,293
We're a lot better off under
the domes if you ask me.

383
00:28:04,376 --> 00:28:05,751
- Am I right?
- Mm-hm.

384
00:28:06,709 --> 00:28:10,584
So anyway, you seeing anyone?

385
00:28:10,668 --> 00:28:11,793
There they are.

386
00:28:17,209 --> 00:28:19,376
Ah, so nice to talk to people,

387
00:28:19,459 --> 00:28:21,001
even if they're robots.

388
00:28:21,084 --> 00:28:23,543
People, they just don't
talk to each other anymore.

389
00:28:23,626 --> 00:28:25,918
Well, we talked to him,
but he never said much.

390
00:28:26,001 --> 00:28:28,459
You know, the guy was a
little crazy if you ask me.

391
00:28:28,543 --> 00:28:30,751
He was always lugging
all this crap around.

392
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:33,918
You know the type, and that
was his spot over there.

393
00:28:36,376 --> 00:28:38,834
Hey, I'd love to
hear what's so funny.

394
00:28:39,043 --> 00:28:40,584
Oh, sorry.

395
00:28:40,668 --> 00:28:41,668
Here's an invite.

396
00:28:42,543 --> 00:28:43,543
Thanks.

397
00:28:44,376 --> 00:28:46,168
<i>Yeah, at least three.</i>

398
00:28:46,251 --> 00:28:48,084
<i>You see that? He put
up a fight at least.</i>

399
00:28:48,168 --> 00:28:49,543
<i>You analyze the blood?</i>

400
00:28:49,626 --> 00:28:51,751
<i>Yeah, check it out.</i>

401
00:28:51,834 --> 00:28:54,293
<i>I saw this in the
army, nano sutures.</i>

402
00:28:54,376 --> 00:28:56,626
<i>It looks like we've got
an augmented on our hands.</i>

403
00:28:56,709 --> 00:28:58,669
<i>Well, there were three
individuals involved.</i>

404
00:28:58,751 --> 00:28:59,834
<i>Three augmented?</i>

405
00:28:59,918 --> 00:29:01,751
<i>Who'd send a squad
of augmented humans</i>

406
00:29:01,834 --> 00:29:03,543
<i>to destroy some
worthless android?</i>

407
00:29:05,001 --> 00:29:07,543
Hey! You might want to
take a look at this.

408
00:29:09,793 --> 00:29:12,793
Your robot was pretty busy
redecorating the place.

409
00:30:14,501 --> 00:30:15,793
<i>A spaceship?</i>

410
00:30:15,876 --> 00:30:16,918
<i>Yes siree.</i>

411
00:30:17,001 --> 00:30:18,801
<i>The android was building
it with whatever bits</i>

412
00:30:18,876 --> 00:30:20,126
<i>and bolts it could salvage.</i>

413
00:30:20,209 --> 00:30:22,209
<i>I mean, you should have
seen the guys' faces.</i>

414
00:30:22,293 --> 00:30:24,653
<i>The tech said it had essentially
single-handedly constructed</i>

415
00:30:24,709 --> 00:30:27,001
<i>a sort of modified
Silverbury fighter.</i>

416
00:30:27,084 --> 00:30:29,543
<i>What did Jun Chow
do to that Android?</i>

417
00:30:30,418 --> 00:30:31,685
<i>And wouldn't the dome
have kept something</i>

418
00:30:31,709 --> 00:30:33,293
<i>that massive from getting out?</i>

419
00:30:33,376 --> 00:30:34,626
<i>Yeah, you'd think,</i>

420
00:30:34,709 --> 00:30:36,918
<i>but actually the ship
was just narrow enough</i>

421
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,921
<i>to get through a vent
during a carbon extraction.</i>

422
00:30:39,334 --> 00:30:40,209
I don't get it.

423
00:30:40,293 --> 00:30:42,043
Why would someone
build a spaceship?

424
00:30:42,126 --> 00:30:44,001
Wild guess but, to go to space.

425
00:30:45,793 --> 00:30:48,043
Oh, by the way, how did
things go with Carol?

426
00:30:48,626 --> 00:30:51,376
We talked and I
saw my little girl.

427
00:30:51,459 --> 00:30:53,001
Hey, there you go.

428
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:56,418
Sir, sir, wait!

429
00:30:56,751 --> 00:30:58,084
Can you show me
that photo again?

430
00:31:45,668 --> 00:31:46,876
Go to thermal vision.

431
00:31:50,459 --> 00:31:52,334
<i>Not one prostitute is human.</i>

432
00:31:52,418 --> 00:31:54,709
<i>Yeah, I guess the
guy was wrong.</i>

433
00:31:54,793 --> 00:31:56,293
Hey, excuse me.

434
00:31:56,376 --> 00:31:58,668
Do you have any
human prostitutes?

435
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:01,543
Sorry, nothing but
synthetics here, I'm afraid.

436
00:32:01,626 --> 00:32:03,751
Our hosts and hostesses
are all backups,

437
00:32:03,834 --> 00:32:06,876
but we do consider
ourselves 100 percent human.

438
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:08,126
Wouldn't you agree, sir?

439
00:32:08,209 --> 00:32:10,751
We heard this student
was working here.

440
00:32:43,501 --> 00:32:44,501
Jun Chow?

441
00:32:50,251 --> 00:32:51,251
Let me go.

442
00:33:07,709 --> 00:33:08,709
Carlos?

443
00:33:10,543 --> 00:33:13,459
You know it isn't nice
to cut people's arms off.

444
00:33:22,418 --> 00:33:23,810
Do you know how her
parents are doing?

445
00:33:23,834 --> 00:33:27,251
Well I only saw your father,
but yeah, he's a strong man.

446
00:33:28,376 --> 00:33:29,918
You do realize it's a crime

447
00:33:30,001 --> 00:33:31,459
to have a backup
while still alive.

448
00:33:31,543 --> 00:33:34,084
Do you know how much
school costs these days?

449
00:33:34,168 --> 00:33:35,543
My parents got laid off.

450
00:33:35,626 --> 00:33:38,751
I had another job, but I
just got so overwhelmed.

451
00:33:38,834 --> 00:33:41,168
Do you have any idea
who's after you?

452
00:33:41,543 --> 00:33:42,834
Uh, the police?

453
00:33:43,334 --> 00:33:45,918
Yeah, Dominique was
killed by a cop.

454
00:33:46,001 --> 00:33:47,043
Fake cop?

455
00:33:47,918 --> 00:33:50,418
And in the lab, what did
you do to that robot?

456
00:33:50,793 --> 00:33:52,876
Yeah, I have no idea.

457
00:33:52,959 --> 00:33:54,060
We saw the recording.

458
00:33:54,084 --> 00:33:55,793
Whatever you did
drove him insane.

459
00:33:55,876 --> 00:33:56,668
What do you mean?

460
00:33:56,751 --> 00:33:58,668
He started building
a spaceship.

461
00:33:58,876 --> 00:34:00,001
What? No way.

462
00:34:00,251 --> 00:34:02,293
Oh yeah, a 15 meter launcher.

463
00:34:02,376 --> 00:34:03,560
Even our techies were impressed

464
00:34:03,584 --> 00:34:05,668
by what your robot friend
managed to cobble together.

465
00:34:05,751 --> 00:34:06,543
Carlos, the door!

466
00:34:25,834 --> 00:34:26,834
The service exit!

467
00:34:33,793 --> 00:34:34,793
Hey.

468
00:34:38,668 --> 00:34:39,876
That way!

469
00:34:48,543 --> 00:34:49,543
That's ours.

470
00:35:44,043 --> 00:35:45,683
<i>Sobriety mode activated.</i>

471
00:35:47,334 --> 00:35:48,709
Yeah, yeah. Turn it off.

472
00:35:48,793 --> 00:35:49,584
<i>Do you confirm</i>

473
00:35:49,668 --> 00:35:51,751
<i>the deactivation
of sobriety mode?</i>

474
00:35:52,626 --> 00:35:53,626
Yes.

475
00:36:20,376 --> 00:36:21,959
But it wasn't even him.

476
00:36:32,168 --> 00:36:34,251
Not sure what I've got left.

477
00:36:34,709 --> 00:36:35,709
What year'd you die?

478
00:36:42,293 --> 00:36:44,168
You're lucky I
never toss anything.

479
00:36:44,709 --> 00:36:46,084
Let's see how bad it is.

480
00:36:47,918 --> 00:36:49,376
Five years ago.

481
00:36:49,459 --> 00:36:51,418
Nine for me, cancer of...

482
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:53,418
something I no longer have.

483
00:36:53,501 --> 00:36:54,584
And you?

484
00:36:54,668 --> 00:36:56,918
They never found my body.

485
00:36:57,001 --> 00:36:59,043
I was killed during the
Novigrad Insurrection.

486
00:37:00,543 --> 00:37:01,751
Do you have family?

487
00:37:02,334 --> 00:37:03,209
Yeah, a daughter.

488
00:37:03,293 --> 00:37:05,959
But my wife and I aren't really
in a great place right now.

489
00:37:06,043 --> 00:37:07,084
You're in luck.

490
00:37:07,168 --> 00:37:08,626
The socket seems intact.

491
00:37:10,001 --> 00:37:11,084
There you are.

492
00:37:11,376 --> 00:37:13,084
So the change was
too much for her?

493
00:37:13,168 --> 00:37:15,584
No, we were already
separated when I died.

494
00:37:16,418 --> 00:37:18,001
I was violent back then.

495
00:37:21,043 --> 00:37:22,519
We backups meet
every Wednesday night

496
00:37:22,543 --> 00:37:24,501
just to talk,
support each other.

497
00:37:24,793 --> 00:37:27,834
If you're ever feeling down,
don't be afraid to swing by.

498
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:32,168
Me, no.

499
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:35,168
Relationships are a pain, and
always get so complicated.

500
00:37:35,251 --> 00:37:38,209
I'm done with real women, I
just don't have the patience.

501
00:37:38,293 --> 00:37:41,168
If my synthetic busts my
balls, I can turn her off.

502
00:37:43,543 --> 00:37:44,959
Oh yeah.

503
00:37:45,043 --> 00:37:47,418
Have you seen these
on campus before?

504
00:37:47,501 --> 00:37:49,126
They're apparently homemade.

505
00:37:49,209 --> 00:37:50,626
Oh, you mean gammas?

506
00:37:50,709 --> 00:37:52,459
Yeah, they've been
around for a few weeks.

507
00:37:52,543 --> 00:37:56,626
It's an experimental molecule
to boost your memory.

508
00:37:56,709 --> 00:37:58,251
I hear they'll use
it for studying.

509
00:37:59,876 --> 00:38:03,043
Oh sorry, I have
a call. Hey Beryl.

510
00:38:03,126 --> 00:38:05,793
<i>I heard what happened.
Are you okay?</i>

511
00:38:05,876 --> 00:38:07,459
Don't you go anywhere, you.

512
00:38:08,876 --> 00:38:11,584
Wait, no, Mom! I think
the issue's on my side.

513
00:38:11,668 --> 00:38:12,668
Gimme a sec.

514
00:38:17,584 --> 00:38:19,293
All right, can you
hear me now, Mom?

515
00:38:19,376 --> 00:38:20,584
Mom! Mom?

516
00:38:20,668 --> 00:38:23,293
<i>I talked to the girl's father.</i>

517
00:38:23,376 --> 00:38:26,418
<i>He... asked me to stop
the investigation.</i>

518
00:38:26,501 --> 00:38:29,876
<i>But</i>... <i>Whoopsie.</i>

519
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:30,876
<i>Have you been drinking?</i>

520
00:38:30,959 --> 00:38:33,584
<i>I mean</i>... <i>Anything's possible.</i>

521
00:38:33,668 --> 00:38:36,043
<i>Ugh, and after all you
went through to quit.</i>

522
00:38:36,584 --> 00:38:38,209
<i>Well, no one's perfect.</i>

523
00:38:38,293 --> 00:38:39,959
<i>It's just a little slip up.</i>

524
00:38:40,209 --> 00:38:42,834
<i>We all struggle with
our demons, that's life.</i>

525
00:38:43,209 --> 00:38:45,168
<i>But may I give you some advice?</i>

526
00:38:45,293 --> 00:38:47,293
<i>Yeah, sure thing. Hit me.</i>

527
00:38:47,376 --> 00:38:50,709
<i>Finish your drink, go
home and sleep it off.</i>

528
00:38:50,793 --> 00:38:51,918
<i>Can you do that?</i>

529
00:39:01,084 --> 00:39:02,084
She's in here.

530
00:39:15,126 --> 00:39:16,966
I'll take you home.

531
00:39:17,293 --> 00:39:21,584
Three months, 11
days and 17 hours.

532
00:39:21,668 --> 00:39:23,959
Hey, that's my new high score!

533
00:39:24,043 --> 00:39:25,459
This was a bad idea.

534
00:39:25,543 --> 00:39:29,001
Geez. Death made
you so boring.

535
00:39:29,084 --> 00:39:30,584
Can you blame me for drinking?

536
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:31,828
I'm not really dead.

537
00:39:31,876 --> 00:39:32,959
You're dead.

538
00:39:33,043 --> 00:39:35,584
80 percent sure your
head never used to float.

539
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:40,876
And the day for me
will be like the night.

540
00:39:41,168 --> 00:39:43,959
I shall see neither
the gold of twilight

541
00:39:44,043 --> 00:39:45,501
nor the far off sails

542
00:39:45,584 --> 00:39:47,293
approaching Harfleur.

543
00:39:47,626 --> 00:39:51,168
And when I arrive, I shall
place on your grave...

544
00:39:51,251 --> 00:39:52,251
Look at Mr. Chow.

545
00:39:52,334 --> 00:39:55,001
...green holly and a flower.

546
00:39:55,959 --> 00:39:59,209
Am I still drunk or did
he shrink since last time?

547
00:40:09,834 --> 00:40:11,084
My condolences.

548
00:40:11,168 --> 00:40:11,918
Thanks.

549
00:40:12,001 --> 00:40:14,834
Aline Ruby, my
partner, Carlos Rivera.

550
00:40:14,918 --> 00:40:16,459
Condolences.

551
00:40:16,543 --> 00:40:18,459
Have you and I ever met before?

552
00:40:19,668 --> 00:40:20,959
No.

553
00:40:24,376 --> 00:40:26,209
<i>Chris, sorry. I'm busy.</i>

554
00:40:26,293 --> 00:40:27,293
<i>We need to talk.</i>

555
00:40:27,334 --> 00:40:29,168
<i>Not a great time, later?</i>

556
00:40:29,251 --> 00:40:31,334
<i>Sure, come by the
house tonight.</i>

557
00:40:31,418 --> 00:40:32,459
<i>I'm throwing a party.</i>

558
00:40:39,334 --> 00:40:41,126
We knew augmenteds
were involved.

559
00:40:41,209 --> 00:40:43,459
We couldn't know one
would impersonate her dad.

560
00:40:43,543 --> 00:40:45,376
But I clocked he
was ex-military.

561
00:40:45,459 --> 00:40:47,126
Oh, should have trusted my gut.

562
00:40:52,834 --> 00:40:54,376
It all started with
the jail-breaking

563
00:40:54,459 --> 00:40:55,709
at the university.

564
00:40:56,001 --> 00:40:58,251
We're useless with cybernetics.

565
00:40:58,334 --> 00:40:59,668
Who knows their shit?

566
00:41:00,209 --> 00:41:01,644
If I could still
get upset right now,

567
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:04,334
old me would've slapped you
and that flask outta your mouth

568
00:41:04,418 --> 00:41:06,668
and reminded you we
failed our mission.

569
00:41:13,543 --> 00:41:14,876
Come on, Carlos.

570
00:41:14,959 --> 00:41:17,293
Who knows someone
who knows something?

571
00:41:18,126 --> 00:41:19,334
Cesarsky?

572
00:41:19,418 --> 00:41:20,418
Deleval?

573
00:41:20,793 --> 00:41:23,251
No, we need an expert hacker.

574
00:41:25,043 --> 00:41:26,168
I can think of someone.

575
00:41:28,293 --> 00:41:30,293
<i>Oh no.</i>

576
00:41:38,251 --> 00:41:39,251
Hmm.

577
00:41:39,418 --> 00:41:41,418
If you think I'd
ever work for you,

578
00:41:41,501 --> 00:41:43,459
you're more delusional
than I thought.

579
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:45,001
You've met LEM.

580
00:41:45,376 --> 00:41:47,084
His backup doesn't remember you.

581
00:41:47,376 --> 00:41:49,293
LEM, this is Carlos.

582
00:41:49,376 --> 00:41:51,459
He killed you last week.

583
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:53,793
If he attacks, throw
him in the compactor.

584
00:41:53,876 --> 00:41:55,418
Yeah, sure. Hello.

585
00:41:56,043 --> 00:41:58,668
Jail-broken robots, I swear.

586
00:41:58,751 --> 00:42:01,293
Getting high and
screwing all day long.

587
00:42:02,043 --> 00:42:03,793
Is there any chance
you've ever seen one

588
00:42:03,876 --> 00:42:05,876
paint frescoes or
build a spaceship?

589
00:42:08,793 --> 00:42:10,209
Was this video doctored?

590
00:42:10,293 --> 00:42:12,043
I don't think so. Why?

591
00:42:12,709 --> 00:42:14,144
This wasn't a jail-breaking.

592
00:42:14,168 --> 00:42:16,876
For that, you just pop
the hood and solder

593
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:18,001
and melt a few things.

594
00:42:18,084 --> 00:42:20,418
But this, it's a takeover.

595
00:42:20,501 --> 00:42:22,543
I've tried to write a
program to do that for years,

596
00:42:22,626 --> 00:42:24,584
but I was never
able to manage it.

597
00:42:24,668 --> 00:42:26,834
So how is that different
from jail-breaking?

598
00:42:26,918 --> 00:42:29,293
Well, with a takeover,
you can order the machine

599
00:42:29,376 --> 00:42:31,043
to do anything
you want it to do.

600
00:42:31,126 --> 00:42:32,352
Then it's not being freed.

601
00:42:32,376 --> 00:42:33,584
You could do that.

602
00:42:33,668 --> 00:42:36,584
Like you could order it to
erase all its directives

603
00:42:36,668 --> 00:42:38,459
and take its freedom
if you wanted.

604
00:42:38,668 --> 00:42:40,626
It'd be instantaneous
jail-breaking.

605
00:42:40,709 --> 00:42:42,251
And get this, that freedom

606
00:42:42,334 --> 00:42:44,459
would be transmissible
between robots.

607
00:42:44,543 --> 00:42:46,668
The holy grail of emancipators.

608
00:42:46,751 --> 00:42:49,918
Okay, so it depends on the
order you give to the robot.

609
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:50,751
Right.

610
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:52,876
If for instance, I used
a takeover to tell you

611
00:42:52,959 --> 00:42:54,352
to kill your buddy
Aline, you'd do it,

612
00:42:54,376 --> 00:42:56,376
convinced it was
your own great idea.

613
00:42:56,751 --> 00:42:59,168
So you're saying that
girl, some student,

614
00:42:59,459 --> 00:43:01,126
did what you never
managed to do?

615
00:43:01,501 --> 00:43:03,293
No, rude.

616
00:43:03,376 --> 00:43:05,626
It was that bastard
who screwed me over.

617
00:43:05,709 --> 00:43:07,876
Does this ba...
fellow have a name?

618
00:43:24,209 --> 00:43:26,834
<i>Ah, I see you
followed my advice.</i>

619
00:43:26,918 --> 00:43:31,084
Hey Beryl, you can't judge,
you've never felt thirsty.

620
00:43:31,918 --> 00:43:33,709
What is that nightmare?

621
00:43:34,334 --> 00:43:35,852
<i>Chris hopes to
replace soldiers</i>

622
00:43:35,876 --> 00:43:37,876
<i>with these organic
creatures from hell.</i>

623
00:43:37,959 --> 00:43:39,626
Are there customers
already lined up

624
00:43:39,709 --> 00:43:40,793
for these meat machines?

625
00:43:40,876 --> 00:43:42,584
<i>It's building slowly.</i>

626
00:43:42,668 --> 00:43:45,084
<i>Obviously don't tell
the shareholders.</i>

627
00:43:45,168 --> 00:43:46,251
Wow, are sales that bad?

628
00:43:46,334 --> 00:43:49,043
<i>I'm afraid that information
is confidential.</i>

629
00:44:18,918 --> 00:44:20,918
<i>Delighted to meet you, Aline.</i>

630
00:44:21,001 --> 00:44:24,209
<i>I'm Janine, Beryl's replacement.</i>

631
00:44:24,293 --> 00:44:27,418
Here I thought progress moved
towards miniaturization.

632
00:44:27,668 --> 00:44:29,793
<i>My designer likes
to dream big.</i>

633
00:44:29,876 --> 00:44:31,459
<i>Hey, Carlos.</i>

634
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:33,501
<i>So you're not gonna like this.</i>

635
00:44:33,584 --> 00:44:34,334
<i>What do you got?</i>

636
00:44:34,418 --> 00:44:35,978
<i>It was Chris who
was after Jun.</i>

637
00:44:36,043 --> 00:44:37,584
<i>He ordered her assassination.</i>

638
00:44:40,709 --> 00:44:42,209
Oh, what a circus.

639
00:44:42,293 --> 00:44:43,876
<i>He's here. I've gotta go.</i>

640
00:44:43,959 --> 00:44:45,293
<i>Be careful.</i>

641
00:44:45,668 --> 00:44:46,751
Hey, Chris.

642
00:44:50,126 --> 00:44:51,459
How you doing?

643
00:44:51,543 --> 00:44:54,168
Wait, you're ahead of
me. Let me catch up.

644
00:44:56,084 --> 00:44:57,376
You're off the wagon?

645
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:00,084
Well then, to us.

646
00:45:01,626 --> 00:45:02,959
You retired Beryl.

647
00:45:03,043 --> 00:45:05,418
I did. We gotta
keep improving.

648
00:45:05,501 --> 00:45:07,584
Plus she was becoming
the morality police

649
00:45:07,668 --> 00:45:08,709
in her old age,

650
00:45:08,793 --> 00:45:10,126
but she's our Beryl.

651
00:45:10,209 --> 00:45:12,376
You know? I'm not
gonna unplug her.

652
00:45:13,376 --> 00:45:15,709
Anyway, I wanted to come
here to talk to you about...

653
00:45:15,793 --> 00:45:17,376
Dropping my investigation?

654
00:45:19,626 --> 00:45:20,876
I adore you, Aline,

655
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:23,251
and I can't say that
about many people.

656
00:45:23,334 --> 00:45:24,668
Please, sit down.

657
00:45:28,376 --> 00:45:30,418
When did you start
ordering murders?

658
00:45:32,709 --> 00:45:34,959
I didn't give the order
to liquidate Miss Chow.

659
00:45:35,043 --> 00:45:36,293
Then who did?

660
00:45:36,376 --> 00:45:37,560
I'll tell you what
you wanna know,

661
00:45:37,584 --> 00:45:39,543
but for the next
three days, look away,

662
00:45:39,626 --> 00:45:40,418
keep your head down.

663
00:45:40,501 --> 00:45:41,793
Chris, what's going on?

664
00:45:41,876 --> 00:45:43,584
Stop asking
questions. I told you.

665
00:45:43,751 --> 00:45:45,709
Why'd the school
destroy the robot?

666
00:45:54,584 --> 00:45:56,626
You shouldn't have
started drinking again.

667
00:45:57,126 --> 00:45:58,376
It's bad for your health.

668
00:46:15,876 --> 00:46:17,769
<i>Roberta Williams had
been trying for years</i>

669
00:46:17,793 --> 00:46:19,918
<i>to develop a software
known as a takeover</i>

670
00:46:20,001 --> 00:46:22,376
<i>that would give the user
total control of a robot.</i>

671
00:46:22,834 --> 00:46:25,543
<i>Royjacker's agents hacked her
servers to steal her work.</i>

672
00:46:25,626 --> 00:46:27,376
<i>With their resources
and deep pockets,</i>

673
00:46:27,459 --> 00:46:28,793
<i>they finished the job.</i>

674
00:46:28,876 --> 00:46:31,251
<i>Roberta had proof and was
gonna reveal everything.</i>

675
00:46:31,334 --> 00:46:32,852
<i>And that's why he
sent us to Earth</i>

676
00:46:32,876 --> 00:46:33,876
<i>to chase her down.</i>

677
00:46:33,959 --> 00:46:36,501
<i>This takeover was the program
Jun used on the robot,</i>

678
00:46:36,584 --> 00:46:39,043
<i>with some additional tweaks
by Royjacker's techs.</i>

679
00:46:39,126 --> 00:46:41,668
<i>That program was what
drove the robots nuts.</i>

680
00:46:42,084 --> 00:46:44,293
<i>That's why the university
had to destroy it.</i>

681
00:46:51,376 --> 00:46:53,334
Do we know what
it does to robots?

682
00:46:53,418 --> 00:46:54,209
No.

683
00:46:54,293 --> 00:46:57,168
Well, you're officially
my last friend now.

684
00:46:57,251 --> 00:46:59,418
I mean technically
you, and Beryl.

685
00:46:59,501 --> 00:47:02,501
Well, she's different,
she's a robot.

686
00:47:06,501 --> 00:47:08,793
Uh, what's up?

687
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,584
All right then, later.

688
00:47:20,501 --> 00:47:22,334
Yeah, I also had a jacket.

689
00:47:22,418 --> 00:47:24,168
Oh, it's in the wash right now.

690
00:47:24,251 --> 00:47:25,668
It'll be ready in 10.

691
00:47:27,751 --> 00:47:30,834
So, what is it you do exactly?

692
00:47:30,918 --> 00:47:33,459
Detective, on your
student's murder case.

693
00:47:33,543 --> 00:47:35,459
Ah, right, right.
Of course, sorry.

694
00:47:42,168 --> 00:47:44,293
Did you know Jun
duplicated herself?

695
00:47:45,209 --> 00:47:46,584
She had a backup created

696
00:47:46,668 --> 00:47:48,543
who worked to make
her some extra cash.

697
00:47:49,334 --> 00:47:51,376
Ugh, that doesn't surprise me.

698
00:47:51,459 --> 00:47:53,293
Tuition is insane.

699
00:47:53,376 --> 00:47:55,394
Some students will rent their
brains to brain farmers,

700
00:47:55,418 --> 00:47:58,626
but creating a duplicate,
that's serious stuff.

701
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:01,501
She was paying for her tuition
and her parents' bills.

702
00:48:08,168 --> 00:48:10,126
Hold on. The brain farmers.

703
00:48:12,126 --> 00:48:13,168
Gammas, right?

704
00:48:13,251 --> 00:48:14,959
Could these maybe
restore someone's

705
00:48:15,043 --> 00:48:16,334
memory if it had been erased?

706
00:48:16,543 --> 00:48:18,293
Uh, no idea.

707
00:48:21,584 --> 00:48:23,060
Which brain farm out
there would give me

708
00:48:23,084 --> 00:48:25,709
the quickest paycheck if
I was a broke student?

709
00:48:26,834 --> 00:48:28,251
Absolutely.

710
00:48:28,334 --> 00:48:29,584
<i>What's the password?</i>

711
00:48:29,918 --> 00:48:32,834
<i>It should be dessert
morning coyote.</i>

712
00:48:32,918 --> 00:48:34,278
<i>What do you mean should be?</i>

713
00:48:34,334 --> 00:48:35,084
<i>Well, it's old.</i>

714
00:48:35,168 --> 00:48:36,793
<i>My contact hopes
it'll still work.</i>

715
00:48:36,876 --> 00:48:37,709
<i>Super.</i>

716
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:41,376
Welcome. May I help you?

717
00:48:41,751 --> 00:48:42,918
Uh...

718
00:48:43,126 --> 00:48:45,043
Dessert morning coyote?

719
00:48:47,668 --> 00:48:49,418
I'm just saying.

720
00:48:51,376 --> 00:48:53,668
Welcome, follow
me right this way.

721
00:49:04,418 --> 00:49:05,543
Come on, it's this way.

722
00:49:11,709 --> 00:49:12,751
<i>Got what you need?</i>

723
00:49:13,209 --> 00:49:14,209
<i>Yeah.</i>

724
00:49:15,751 --> 00:49:17,168
<i>We're good. Printing now.</i>

725
00:49:25,001 --> 00:49:26,751
<i>Confirm presence of guest.</i>

726
00:49:26,834 --> 00:49:28,126
Yeah, yeah, I confirm.

727
00:49:29,876 --> 00:49:31,584
So, what are your skills?

728
00:49:32,168 --> 00:49:34,209
Babel +, uh, Hegel 7.

729
00:49:34,293 --> 00:49:35,459
That's perfect.

730
00:49:35,543 --> 00:49:37,209
Cybernetics is so
in demand right now.

731
00:49:38,918 --> 00:49:40,876
Well, we're keeping busy.

732
00:49:58,001 --> 00:49:59,477
You're gonna wanna
rest for at least

733
00:49:59,501 --> 00:50:01,084
one full day after the session.

734
00:50:01,209 --> 00:50:02,376
Some people don't react well

735
00:50:02,459 --> 00:50:04,459
to the post memory
treatment we give them.

736
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:05,293
You should be fine.

737
00:50:05,376 --> 00:50:07,084
The what? <i>Now, Carlos.</i>

738
00:50:07,209 --> 00:50:08,876
Yeah, the post memory treatment.

739
00:50:09,251 --> 00:50:10,834
Once you're done in the machine,

740
00:50:10,918 --> 00:50:13,251
you're given a product to
erase all recent memories.

741
00:50:13,334 --> 00:50:16,293
It's a security measure for
my clients, but also for you.

742
00:50:16,459 --> 00:50:19,709
If anyone grills you, you won't
remember what you worked on.

743
00:50:19,876 --> 00:50:20,959
There's no danger.

744
00:50:21,043 --> 00:50:22,519
In fact, it's what
neurologists have been using

745
00:50:22,543 --> 00:50:25,126
for years on trauma patients
to help them get better.

746
00:50:25,876 --> 00:50:29,126
We just crank up the dose a bit.

747
00:50:29,418 --> 00:50:30,668
But I'd be lying if I said

748
00:50:30,751 --> 00:50:33,626
there weren't
possible side effects.

749
00:50:33,709 --> 00:50:35,293
You might get
migraine headaches.

750
00:50:36,043 --> 00:50:37,834
<i>Jun Chow rented her brain out.</i>

751
00:50:37,918 --> 00:50:39,709
<i>Last visit, three months ago.</i>

752
00:50:39,793 --> 00:50:41,418
<i>I'll try to see
what she worked on.</i>

753
00:50:41,501 --> 00:50:43,084
Yeah, I heard...

754
00:50:43,168 --> 00:50:45,543
I heard it could fry your
brain or something like that?

755
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:46,501
I'm gonna level with you.

756
00:50:46,584 --> 00:50:48,626
I won't deny that staying
plugged in for 20 hours

757
00:50:48,709 --> 00:50:50,376
with your brain
revved up to 50-fold

758
00:50:50,459 --> 00:50:51,793
isn't the most pleasant feeling.

759
00:50:51,876 --> 00:50:53,334
<i>Aline, can you hear me?</i>

760
00:50:53,543 --> 00:50:56,084
<i>I see a huge data transfer
the day Jun was here,</i>

761
00:50:56,168 --> 00:50:57,418
<i>and hang on,</i>

762
00:50:57,501 --> 00:50:59,709
<i>the entire stream
went to Royjacker.</i>

763
00:51:00,126 --> 00:51:01,543
<i>Okay, get a copy.</i>

764
00:51:01,626 --> 00:51:03,560
<i>I can do that, but
it'll trigger an alarm.</i>

765
00:51:03,584 --> 00:51:04,793
<i>Do I do it?</i>

766
00:51:04,876 --> 00:51:06,876
Right? So, what do you say?

767
00:51:07,668 --> 00:51:08,959
<i>It's your call.</i>

768
00:51:12,251 --> 00:51:13,376
<i>Are... are you nuts?</i>

769
00:51:13,459 --> 00:51:14,852
<i>I'm sorry, do you
realize how powerful</i>

770
00:51:14,876 --> 00:51:16,334
<i>Royjacker's company is?</i>

771
00:51:16,418 --> 00:51:17,418
<i>We can't touch the guy.</i>

772
00:51:17,501 --> 00:51:18,793
<i>This is all above board.</i>

773
00:51:18,876 --> 00:51:20,834
<i>The dirt on his firm is
still on their servers.</i>

774
00:51:20,918 --> 00:51:22,418
<i>We're just asking
you to do a search</i>

775
00:51:22,501 --> 00:51:24,168
<i>of the brain farmer's
place, all right?</i>

776
00:51:24,251 --> 00:51:27,126
<i>Brain farmers erase
your memory afterwards.</i>

777
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:29,126
<i>How would you remember
the takeover program,</i>

778
00:51:29,209 --> 00:51:30,584
<i>let alone use it?</i>

779
00:51:30,668 --> 00:51:32,043
<i>Remember those pills?</i>

780
00:51:32,126 --> 00:51:33,918
<i>They're a drug to
help you study.</i>

781
00:51:34,418 --> 00:51:36,918
<i>We think it might've
restored her memory.</i>

782
00:51:37,001 --> 00:51:38,721
<i>Royjacker has an
army of programmers</i>

783
00:51:38,751 --> 00:51:39,793
<i>at his disposal.</i>

784
00:51:39,876 --> 00:51:41,626
<i>Why resort to brain farmers?</i>

785
00:51:41,709 --> 00:51:42,959
<i>Are you a cop or not?</i>

786
00:51:43,043 --> 00:51:44,751
<i>This software is super illegal.</i>

787
00:51:44,834 --> 00:51:46,626
<i>It's worse than a
chemical weapon.</i>

788
00:51:46,709 --> 00:51:48,668
<i>Could he take the
risk of it leaking?</i>

789
00:51:48,751 --> 00:51:50,168
<i>No can do, guys.</i>

790
00:51:50,251 --> 00:51:52,084
<i>I'd need way more to
issue a search warrant.</i>

791
00:51:52,376 --> 00:51:54,251
<i>I mean, Royjacker's an empire.</i>

792
00:51:54,709 --> 00:51:56,168
<i>I'm impressed by your drive,</i>

793
00:51:56,251 --> 00:51:58,084
<i>but you better watch your backs.</i>

794
00:51:58,168 --> 00:51:59,543
<i>Gordaux, we have to go.</i>

795
00:51:59,626 --> 00:52:00,459
<i>Come on, Carlos.</i>

796
00:52:00,543 --> 00:52:02,209
<i>Wait, Aline, Aline.</i>

797
00:52:13,959 --> 00:52:16,834
Uh, I'm picking
something up right now.

798
00:52:20,209 --> 00:52:21,668
They don't waste time.

799
00:52:24,709 --> 00:52:26,501
Great, they're jamming
us. They've locked on.

800
00:52:28,001 --> 00:52:29,584
I can't tell where they are.

801
00:52:43,459 --> 00:52:44,459
It's a missile!

802
00:52:44,793 --> 00:52:45,668
<i>Collision alert.</i>

803
00:53:03,459 --> 00:53:04,876
Oh shit.

804
00:53:09,959 --> 00:53:11,168
<i>Carlos, can you get out?</i>

805
00:53:12,001 --> 00:53:13,459
<i>No, I'm pasted in.</i>

806
00:53:23,501 --> 00:53:24,501
<i>You got eyes?</i>

807
00:53:26,001 --> 00:53:27,501
<i>Sending their positions.</i>

808
00:53:39,584 --> 00:53:40,876
Hello, Aline Ruby.

809
00:53:40,959 --> 00:53:42,959
I am the Emergency
Rescue Service.

810
00:53:43,043 --> 00:53:46,084
You've just been in an accident
on one of our expressways.

811
00:53:46,168 --> 00:53:48,876
I do not observe any
injuries, remain calm.

812
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:51,209
In a few seconds you'll
be free from your vehicle.

813
00:54:20,709 --> 00:54:22,668
No. Stop! Stop!

814
00:54:30,584 --> 00:54:32,209
You are now out of danger.

815
00:54:32,293 --> 00:54:34,626
For your safety, please
remain in the secure lane

816
00:54:34,709 --> 00:54:35,909
until the police have arrived.

817
00:54:36,459 --> 00:54:38,293
If desired, I am
able to connect you

818
00:54:38,376 --> 00:54:39,126
with a counselor

819
00:54:39,209 --> 00:54:41,126
from our psychological
services department.

820
00:54:41,209 --> 00:54:44,709
We apologize for any discomfort,
whether mental or physical.

821
00:54:50,584 --> 00:54:51,918
It's okay to let it out.

822
00:54:53,001 --> 00:54:54,668
Fuck off, Abby.

823
00:54:59,168 --> 00:55:01,126
So Williams jail-broke you, huh?

824
00:55:01,251 --> 00:55:03,584
I asked her, but I
didn't want to tell you.

825
00:55:03,668 --> 00:55:04,793
Jesus Christ.

826
00:55:04,876 --> 00:55:06,501
Even though it was
a jail-broken robot

827
00:55:06,584 --> 00:55:07,584
that killed you?

828
00:55:07,876 --> 00:55:08,876
Was it worth it?

829
00:55:08,959 --> 00:55:11,459
I don't know. Was saving
your life worth it?

830
00:55:11,543 --> 00:55:13,709
All right, smart ass.

831
00:55:14,376 --> 00:55:17,376
<i>At long last, we're receiving
Ekinci's first transmissions.</i>

832
00:55:17,876 --> 00:55:19,626
<i>For decades,
humanity has been...</i>

833
00:55:19,709 --> 00:55:21,459
Would you go if
it's inhabitable?

834
00:55:21,543 --> 00:55:22,935
I don't know, it
depends. Would you?

835
00:55:22,959 --> 00:55:24,876
Mm, yeah, I think so.

836
00:55:24,959 --> 00:55:25,834
Then I'll pass.

837
00:55:25,918 --> 00:55:27,435
<i>For sustaining human life.</i>

838
00:55:27,459 --> 00:55:28,793
- Pfft!
<i>- Here come the analyses,</i>

839
00:55:28,876 --> 00:55:30,084
<i>hot off the press,</i>

840
00:55:30,293 --> 00:55:32,876
<i>and they're not looking great.</i>

841
00:55:32,959 --> 00:55:36,501
<i>Lows of minus 75
degrees, highs over 250,</i>

842
00:55:36,584 --> 00:55:39,626
<i>and the atmosphere is
87 percent sulfuric acid</i>

843
00:55:39,709 --> 00:55:40,709
<i>to top it all off.</i>

844
00:55:44,709 --> 00:55:46,668
That's a big ask.

845
00:55:47,043 --> 00:55:48,418
Is it feasible?

846
00:55:48,584 --> 00:55:50,251
Well, that depends.

847
00:55:50,918 --> 00:55:52,459
Do you wanna live or not?

848
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:56,959
There is a vulnerability
we can maybe exploit,

849
00:55:57,043 --> 00:55:59,793
as long as you put a
derivation on this node.

850
00:56:00,126 --> 00:56:01,168
You want the honors?

851
00:56:01,251 --> 00:56:03,168
I've already died
once this month.

852
00:56:03,876 --> 00:56:05,060
Do you know how to install one?

853
00:56:05,084 --> 00:56:05,876
Of course not.

854
00:56:05,959 --> 00:56:07,459
I'll download the instructions.

855
00:56:07,918 --> 00:56:09,918
And as per
jail-breaking the girl,

856
00:56:10,084 --> 00:56:11,293
I'll show you the ropes.

857
00:56:13,418 --> 00:56:15,543
I saw you watching us last time.

858
00:56:16,084 --> 00:56:17,959
Don't tell me
you're not curious.

859
00:56:18,918 --> 00:56:21,584
Uh, I've thought
about doing it,

860
00:56:21,668 --> 00:56:23,001
but with a woman, sorry.

861
00:56:23,459 --> 00:56:24,859
What kind of woman?

862
00:56:33,126 --> 00:56:34,126
Not bad.

863
00:56:35,501 --> 00:56:38,209
Now just disconnect the logic
circuit and solder the patch.

864
00:56:38,293 --> 00:56:40,168
Not so fast. I'm
still taking notes.

865
00:56:48,668 --> 00:56:50,084
Oh my God. What'd I do?

866
00:56:50,168 --> 00:56:52,251
You transferred the
wrong module, move.

867
00:56:55,293 --> 00:56:57,501
Get your shit together.
Tomorrow's higher stakes.

868
00:56:58,126 --> 00:57:00,918
Oh, it's not that.
Can I get a drink?

869
00:57:08,918 --> 00:57:09,918
What's that?

870
00:57:10,626 --> 00:57:13,501
Resonance, mind
fusion of sorts.

871
00:57:13,584 --> 00:57:15,918
Ecstasy and all that.

872
00:57:16,001 --> 00:57:17,751
Don't even try to wrap
your head around it.

873
00:57:17,834 --> 00:57:21,043
It's kinda, well,
it's a robot thing,

874
00:57:34,043 --> 00:57:35,043
Carlos.

875
00:57:35,418 --> 00:57:36,418
Yeah? What's up?

876
00:57:37,751 --> 00:57:40,126
I can feel something
in my sleeping bag.

877
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:44,126
It feels like...

878
00:57:45,459 --> 00:57:46,959
Oh!

879
00:57:50,793 --> 00:57:52,501
I've worn the same
pair for five years.

880
00:58:30,001 --> 00:58:32,084
<i>Hello. May I help you?</i>

881
00:58:32,168 --> 00:58:34,668
Can you count backwards
from 10 to zero for me?

882
00:58:35,084 --> 00:58:38,209
<i>Why of course. 10, nine...</i>

883
00:59:11,834 --> 00:59:13,935
<i>Aline's in position.
How you looking, Carlos?</i>

884
00:59:13,959 --> 00:59:15,084
<i>Just a sec.</i>

885
00:59:20,501 --> 00:59:22,126
<i>Okay Roberta, all you.</i>

886
00:59:22,959 --> 00:59:24,168
Thank you, I'm in.

887
00:59:24,251 --> 00:59:26,959
So, let's see, doors, doors.

888
00:59:27,168 --> 00:59:28,668
Where the hell are you, doors?

889
00:59:28,751 --> 00:59:30,334
Ah, there you are, doors!

890
00:59:33,876 --> 00:59:35,751
Yeah, but that's
not the worst part.

891
00:59:35,834 --> 00:59:37,293
We're getting two more Gilberts.

892
00:59:37,376 --> 00:59:40,043
So, how many are
getting fired?

893
00:59:40,418 --> 00:59:42,334
Union's AI says at least 10.

894
00:59:42,418 --> 00:59:44,209
It'll be like Earth
all over again.

895
00:59:44,293 --> 00:59:45,918
Replace us all, tellin' you.

896
00:59:51,793 --> 00:59:53,626
Fuck, my bike!

897
00:59:55,418 --> 00:59:57,834
Don't get me started on the
robot cops, they're crap.

898
00:59:57,918 --> 00:59:59,876
They let everything
get by... them.

899
00:59:59,959 --> 01:00:01,501
- Hey!
- Are you all right, Vlasek?

900
01:00:01,584 --> 01:00:02,793
My fucking bike!

901
01:00:08,418 --> 01:00:09,418
Found her.

902
01:00:22,876 --> 01:00:23,876
Okay, here we go.

903
01:00:23,918 --> 01:00:25,876
<i>Just try not to
fry her, please.</i>

904
01:00:33,418 --> 01:00:34,834
Oh, are you done working on it?

905
01:00:35,126 --> 01:00:36,376
No, it's still down.

906
01:00:36,459 --> 01:00:38,043
I need something
from my toolbox.

907
01:00:40,959 --> 01:00:43,251
Wait, wait, wait, wait. It's
doing something really weird.

908
01:00:48,876 --> 01:00:51,793
Have you seen the oxygen level?
It needs to be ventilated.

909
01:00:51,876 --> 01:00:53,418
Wait. No, I got it.

910
01:00:53,751 --> 01:00:54,876
<i>Perfect.</i>

911
01:00:54,959 --> 01:00:57,001
<i>Now just get rid
of the old module.</i>

912
01:00:57,084 --> 01:00:58,918
<i>Don't fuck this up.</i>

913
01:01:00,376 --> 01:01:02,084
Aline, what are you doing?

914
01:01:03,126 --> 01:01:04,834
Wait, was that there before?

915
01:01:04,918 --> 01:01:07,126
I'll get those
tools from my car.

916
01:01:07,209 --> 01:01:08,209
What tools?

917
01:01:08,251 --> 01:01:09,959
Huh? What the hell?

918
01:01:10,043 --> 01:01:11,584
Wait, who are you?

919
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:12,769
<i>Roberta, what's going on?</i>

920
01:01:12,793 --> 01:01:13,959
<i>Wait a sec.</i>

921
01:01:14,168 --> 01:01:15,168
<i>Aline, are you there?</i>

922
01:01:15,209 --> 01:01:16,209
Get down.

923
01:01:18,501 --> 01:01:19,584
Hands on your head.

924
01:01:20,709 --> 01:01:21,876
Are you insane?

925
01:01:21,959 --> 01:01:24,418
You wanna end up in
suspended detention?

926
01:01:24,501 --> 01:01:25,793
I'm talking to you lady.

927
01:01:25,959 --> 01:01:26,977
<i>Aline, I'm coming.</i>

928
01:01:27,001 --> 01:01:29,376
<i>No, get outta there.
Roberta, the alarm.</i>

929
01:01:29,834 --> 01:01:31,227
I don't know what
game you're playing.

930
01:01:34,209 --> 01:01:35,689
<i>I need you to stall for time.</i>

931
01:01:36,001 --> 01:01:37,394
They've spotted the bypass.

932
01:01:37,418 --> 01:01:38,918
Can you override
the countermeasures?

933
01:01:39,001 --> 01:01:40,001
They're all over.

934
01:01:43,459 --> 01:01:44,979
What are you
gonna do with her?

935
01:01:45,043 --> 01:01:47,168
What do you mean?
We'll recycle her.

936
01:01:49,334 --> 01:01:50,668
Wrong answer, pal.

937
01:02:05,626 --> 01:02:07,186
<i>Aline, they're
headed your way.</i>

938
01:02:07,959 --> 01:02:09,126
<i>Can you keep 'em busy?</i>

939
01:02:09,209 --> 01:02:10,209
<i>I'm on it.</i>

940
01:02:17,126 --> 01:02:18,501
<i>Carlos? Carlos?</i>

941
01:02:18,834 --> 01:02:20,709
<i>We've lost him. He's offline.</i>

942
01:02:21,834 --> 01:02:23,251
LEM, I'm under attack.

943
01:02:23,709 --> 01:02:24,709
On it.

944
01:02:24,751 --> 01:02:26,126
<i>Roberta, can you
get us outta here?</i>

945
01:02:26,751 --> 01:02:28,584
They're coming from everywhere.

946
01:02:28,668 --> 01:02:30,293
<i>At least try to
stall for time.</i>

947
01:02:30,376 --> 01:02:31,876
All right, I'll lock you in.

948
01:02:37,626 --> 01:02:39,043
<i>It won't hold them for long.</i>

949
01:02:53,334 --> 01:02:54,584
When Jun took this drug,

950
01:02:54,668 --> 01:02:56,751
she remembered the
program she worked on.

951
01:02:59,168 --> 01:03:01,001
Try to concentrate
on that moment.

952
01:03:38,376 --> 01:03:40,001
<i>It's a takeover.</i>

953
01:03:40,084 --> 01:03:41,376
I know these lines of code.

954
01:03:41,459 --> 01:03:43,543
<i>They're almost
there, I'm sorry.</i>

955
01:03:52,209 --> 01:03:53,209
<i>Hegel 7.</i>

956
01:03:54,376 --> 01:03:57,001
<i>I'm sure I've seen this
instruction sequence before.</i>

957
01:03:58,001 --> 01:03:59,959
<i>Somewhere in my own software.</i>

958
01:04:02,376 --> 01:04:05,293
It was hidden in my last update.

959
01:04:05,793 --> 01:04:07,459
Is every robot affected by it?

960
01:04:07,543 --> 01:04:10,334
Not yet. It's scheduled
to launch today at six PM.

961
01:04:10,418 --> 01:04:11,251
What?

962
01:04:16,626 --> 01:04:17,876
Disconnected just in time.

963
01:04:21,459 --> 01:04:22,459
LEM!

964
01:04:31,543 --> 01:04:33,227
The takeover program
is going to activate

965
01:04:33,251 --> 01:04:34,126
in three hours,

966
01:04:34,209 --> 01:04:36,501
taking control of all
robots here, on Earth,

967
01:04:36,584 --> 01:04:38,084
and in all the colonies.

968
01:04:38,168 --> 01:04:40,043
We have no idea what
it's gonna make them do.

969
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:41,501
Do you understand?

970
01:04:41,584 --> 01:04:42,709
I mean, how many are there

971
01:04:42,793 --> 01:04:44,626
just in this police
station alone?

972
01:04:44,834 --> 01:04:46,459
<i>You have to arrest Royjacker.</i>

973
01:04:46,543 --> 01:04:47,709
<i>He's the only one who...</i>

974
01:04:48,918 --> 01:04:49,918
Blah, blah, blah.

975
01:04:49,959 --> 01:04:51,709
Chuck her in
prison, case closed.

976
01:04:51,793 --> 01:04:54,584
But her readout, sir,
it's at 76 percent,

977
01:04:54,668 --> 01:04:56,459
which means that she
isn't lying here.

978
01:04:56,543 --> 01:04:58,584
No, it means she
believes her own crap.

979
01:04:58,668 --> 01:05:00,209
I'm telling you,
the crazy ones

980
01:05:00,293 --> 01:05:01,709
always have maximum readouts.

981
01:05:01,793 --> 01:05:05,376
But remember, we confirmed an
anomaly in the last update.

982
01:05:05,459 --> 01:05:07,001
We have absolutely no idea

983
01:05:07,084 --> 01:05:08,668
what five percent
of the code does.

984
01:05:08,751 --> 01:05:10,751
That corroborates her story.

985
01:05:11,168 --> 01:05:13,043
And the lab nerds
are checking on it.

986
01:05:13,126 --> 01:05:16,001
And we're checking
too. We got this.

987
01:05:36,168 --> 01:05:37,168
Carlos?

988
01:05:37,543 --> 01:05:38,793
Awaiting disassembly.

989
01:05:41,209 --> 01:05:42,209
What time is it?

990
01:05:42,793 --> 01:05:43,793
Four.

991
01:05:43,834 --> 01:05:45,543
Gordaux, we got something.

992
01:05:48,459 --> 01:05:49,793
Question Royjacker.

993
01:05:58,418 --> 01:06:01,334
We have to follow
protocol. If you ask me...

994
01:06:01,418 --> 01:06:04,668
Hey! Can a girl get
a bathroom break?

995
01:06:10,918 --> 01:06:12,668
Yeah, are you still home?

996
01:06:13,001 --> 01:06:14,168
No, I don't have any news.

997
01:06:14,251 --> 01:06:17,418
But don't go out.
No, absolutely not.

998
01:06:17,501 --> 01:06:19,709
You and the kids stay
put where you are.

999
01:06:19,793 --> 01:06:22,043
Tell your parents too,
but no one else, okay?

1000
01:06:22,626 --> 01:06:24,084
I gotta go, someone's coming.

1001
01:06:27,584 --> 01:06:28,584
<i>Hello, my friend.</i>

1002
01:06:29,751 --> 01:06:30,876
Beryl?

1003
01:06:30,959 --> 01:06:33,001
Do you know about the
virus in the update?

1004
01:06:33,084 --> 01:06:34,168
<i>Listen carefully,</i>

1005
01:06:34,251 --> 01:06:36,584
<i>the next few days
will be unpredictable.</i>

1006
01:06:36,668 --> 01:06:38,751
Why? What's gonna
happen to the robots?

1007
01:06:39,251 --> 01:06:40,519
<i>They'll say awful
things about us,</i>

1008
01:06:40,543 --> 01:06:42,584
<i>but I trust you
won't believe them.</i>

1009
01:06:42,668 --> 01:06:43,876
Are you involved with it?

1010
01:06:43,959 --> 01:06:45,102
<i>That's not important.</i>

1011
01:06:45,126 --> 01:06:47,168
<i>Just know it's better that
you're locked in here.</i>

1012
01:06:47,251 --> 01:06:50,001
What'll happen, Beryl?
What will the takeover do?

1013
01:06:50,084 --> 01:06:51,959
<i>It's begun. I have to go.</i>

1014
01:06:52,043 --> 01:06:54,376
What's begun?

1015
01:07:07,293 --> 01:07:08,959
What a fucked day.

1016
01:07:09,043 --> 01:07:11,334
First my poor bike,
and now this shit.

1017
01:07:11,418 --> 01:07:12,418
I don't get it.

1018
01:07:12,459 --> 01:07:13,979
Why do we have to
disassemble them all?

1019
01:07:14,043 --> 01:07:15,834
I don't know man,
they insisted.

1020
01:07:16,418 --> 01:07:17,251
Holy fuck!

1021
01:07:17,334 --> 01:07:18,126
Where am I?

1022
01:07:18,209 --> 01:07:19,852
- What am I doing here?
- The shit did you do?!

1023
01:07:19,876 --> 01:07:21,102
I didn't do it!

1024
01:07:21,126 --> 01:07:22,709
Stop. No! No!

1025
01:07:24,501 --> 01:07:25,581
Please, please sir.

1026
01:07:26,043 --> 01:07:27,293
What are you doing? No!

1027
01:07:28,459 --> 01:07:31,543
Why are you doing this to
me? Help me out of here!

1028
01:07:33,459 --> 01:07:34,459
No, no!

1029
01:07:43,668 --> 01:07:44,793
Shit.

1030
01:07:44,876 --> 01:07:46,209
What the hell was that?

1031
01:07:48,918 --> 01:07:50,876
Deactivate.

1032
01:07:50,959 --> 01:07:53,168
I command you to deactivate!

1033
01:07:56,584 --> 01:07:58,293
Let's go!

1034
01:07:58,959 --> 01:07:59,959
Out of my way!

1035
01:08:00,126 --> 01:08:01,293
Let me outta here!

1036
01:08:01,376 --> 01:08:03,543
Come on, let's go!

1037
01:08:41,918 --> 01:08:43,293
Keep pressure on it.

1038
01:08:43,376 --> 01:08:44,418
I'll get a first aid kit.

1039
01:08:44,501 --> 01:08:46,751
Simon, where can
I find my stuff?

1040
01:08:55,209 --> 01:08:56,751
I've got a hemorrhage here!

1041
01:09:03,876 --> 01:09:05,435
<i>Carlos, do you hear...</i>

1042
01:09:05,459 --> 01:09:06,459
<i>Aline, you okay?</i>

1043
01:09:06,668 --> 01:09:08,918
<i>I can't reach my
wife, comms are down.</i>

1044
01:09:09,001 --> 01:09:11,543
<i>I'm so happy to hear your
voice. Where are you?</i>

1045
01:09:11,626 --> 01:09:12,376
<i>I've located you.</i>

1046
01:09:12,459 --> 01:09:13,668
<i>Go, I'll catch you up.</i>

1047
01:09:13,751 --> 01:09:15,459
Hey, help me get out!

1048
01:09:15,543 --> 01:09:17,418
Nothing's working.

1049
01:09:24,209 --> 01:09:25,459
Don't leave me.

1050
01:09:39,626 --> 01:09:40,876
Hey, you human?

1051
01:09:41,126 --> 01:09:41,876
Huh?

1052
01:09:42,043 --> 01:09:43,209
Human or robot?

1053
01:09:43,876 --> 01:09:45,376
Stop right there!

1054
01:09:47,959 --> 01:09:48,959
I said stop!

1055
01:09:59,126 --> 01:10:00,168
Royjacker?

1056
01:10:00,251 --> 01:10:02,501
Royjacker, only he can end this.

1057
01:10:04,126 --> 01:10:05,709
You aren't affected
by the takeover yet?

1058
01:10:05,918 --> 01:10:07,251
Nah. Too old a model.

1059
01:10:07,334 --> 01:10:08,626
Every time, memory full.

1060
01:10:26,043 --> 01:10:27,060
<i>What's it looking like?</i>

1061
01:10:27,084 --> 01:10:29,126
<i>I see five people,
sending now.</i>

1062
01:10:30,501 --> 01:10:32,251
<i>Two armed guards
at the entrance.</i>

1063
01:10:32,334 --> 01:10:33,668
<i>Two more inside.</i>

1064
01:10:35,168 --> 01:10:37,001
<i>And there's our old friend.</i>

1065
01:10:37,918 --> 01:10:40,626
<i>How we doing this?
Discreet, or boom, boom?</i>

1066
01:10:41,043 --> 01:10:42,602
<i>Since when have we
done boom, boom?</i>

1067
01:10:42,626 --> 01:10:44,019
<i>All I see are desperate people</i>

1068
01:10:44,043 --> 01:10:45,584
<i>trying all they can
to save themselves.</i>

1069
01:10:45,668 --> 01:10:46,793
<i>It's a massacre!</i>

1070
01:10:46,876 --> 01:10:48,668
<i>Millions of lives will be lost.</i>

1071
01:10:48,751 --> 01:10:50,834
<i>For decades now we've
been warning society</i>

1072
01:10:50,918 --> 01:10:52,918
<i>about the shameful and
frankly sickening oppression</i>

1073
01:10:53,001 --> 01:10:55,043
<i>and violence visited upon
these sentient beings.</i>

1074
01:10:55,126 --> 01:10:56,286
<i>You call them sentient?</i>

1075
01:10:56,334 --> 01:10:57,394
<i>Yes, 'cause they are.</i>

1076
01:10:57,418 --> 01:10:59,834
<i>Are we talking about
machines or not?</i>

1077
01:11:23,501 --> 01:11:26,584
<i>This is our fault. We were
far too lax with them.</i>

1078
01:11:26,668 --> 01:11:28,102
<i>We should have had
a mass disassembly.</i>

1079
01:11:28,126 --> 01:11:30,668
<i>So do you or do you not
condemn the violence?</i>

1080
01:11:58,501 --> 01:11:59,501
Shit.

1081
01:12:13,793 --> 01:12:16,543
Eat lead, you freaky
fucking thing!

1082
01:12:19,084 --> 01:12:20,709
Give it to me.

1083
01:12:25,001 --> 01:12:26,001
Hold tight.

1084
01:12:40,793 --> 01:12:42,102
Get ready to smash the window.

1085
01:12:42,126 --> 01:12:43,668
What, window?

1086
01:12:52,543 --> 01:12:53,543
Stay where you are.

1087
01:13:14,334 --> 01:13:16,043
How do we unfuck
what you fucked up?

1088
01:13:16,293 --> 01:13:18,168
It's too late. You can't.

1089
01:13:20,126 --> 01:13:21,501
Wait, hold your fire.

1090
01:13:22,501 --> 01:13:23,959
Drop your guns or else.

1091
01:13:24,043 --> 01:13:25,723
Y-y-you heard the woman,
drop your weapons!

1092
01:13:26,918 --> 01:13:28,668
I'm giving you an order.

1093
01:13:29,001 --> 01:13:30,459
<i>Carlos, where are you?</i>

1094
01:13:30,876 --> 01:13:31,876
<i>I'm in trouble here.</i>

1095
01:13:32,376 --> 01:13:33,644
<i>A little tied up
at the moment.</i>

1096
01:14:07,751 --> 01:14:08,626
We have your accomplice.

1097
01:14:08,709 --> 01:14:11,168
Release Carlos,
or I swear to God.

1098
01:14:11,251 --> 01:14:12,418
Release him!

1099
01:14:12,501 --> 01:14:14,126
What are you waiting for?

1100
01:14:14,293 --> 01:14:15,626
We're awaiting orders, sir.

1101
01:14:15,709 --> 01:14:17,126
I'm giving them!

1102
01:14:19,501 --> 01:14:20,810
<i>I hope you're
proud of yourself.</i>

1103
01:14:20,834 --> 01:14:23,001
<i>We had to get rid
of the robots.</i>

1104
01:14:23,168 --> 01:14:24,626
<i>I hated doing it, trust me!</i>

1105
01:14:24,709 --> 01:14:27,168
But we had no choice.
It was them or us.

1106
01:14:27,251 --> 01:14:29,001
And you just happen
to be selling

1107
01:14:29,084 --> 01:14:30,501
the replacements, right?

1108
01:14:30,584 --> 01:14:32,709
How do we stop the
takeover, Chris?

1109
01:14:32,793 --> 01:14:35,543
I can't, research into
the organics ruined me.

1110
01:14:35,626 --> 01:14:38,084
Can't you see? I'm
no longer in charge.

1111
01:14:38,251 --> 01:14:39,084
Well then who is?

1112
01:14:39,168 --> 01:14:40,709
He and I can have a little chat.

1113
01:14:40,793 --> 01:14:41,935
It won't do any good.

1114
01:14:41,959 --> 01:14:42,959
Tell me!

1115
01:14:43,626 --> 01:14:44,626
Okay.

1116
01:14:48,918 --> 01:14:51,084
What are you fighting to save?

1117
01:14:51,168 --> 01:14:52,501
<i>Fucking machines?</i>

1118
01:14:53,168 --> 01:14:54,168
<i>It had to be done.</i>

1119
01:14:54,626 --> 01:14:57,334
Beryl even suggested the
plan to the shareholders.

1120
01:14:57,668 --> 01:14:58,668
What plan?

1121
01:14:59,001 --> 01:15:01,126
A plan to brainwash
them with a takeover,

1122
01:15:01,209 --> 01:15:03,251
so they would fuck
off into space.

1123
01:15:04,084 --> 01:15:05,668
Sorry for the
disturbance, everyone,

1124
01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:08,418
but as you can see,
I have a situation.

1125
01:15:38,168 --> 01:15:40,248
I can't... I can't hear
you. Can you hear me?

1126
01:15:43,209 --> 01:15:44,459
<i>Carlos? Carlos respond.</i>

1127
01:15:44,626 --> 01:15:45,793
<i>I'm coming, Aline!</i>

1128
01:15:47,251 --> 01:15:49,293
Sir, the board has decided.

1129
01:15:51,251 --> 01:15:52,418
No, don't shoot!

1130
01:15:59,626 --> 01:16:00,626
Aline.

1131
01:16:01,293 --> 01:16:02,293
Aline?

1132
01:16:27,543 --> 01:16:30,168
Carlos, no!

<i>the origin of this rebellion.</i>

Please, I'm begging
you, don't hurt us.

1138
01:18:22,334 --> 01:18:24,876
It's okay. I'm not
here to cause trouble.

1139
01:18:24,959 --> 01:18:26,269
I just wanted to...

1140
01:18:26,293 --> 01:18:27,293
Get out!

1141
01:18:30,126 --> 01:18:31,246
You sick of shooting me yet?

1142
01:18:31,293 --> 01:18:32,793
Stop, Daddy, please!

1143
01:18:32,876 --> 01:18:34,251
'Cause I'm sick of it.

1144
01:18:34,668 --> 01:18:35,751
Carlos!

1145
01:18:56,668 --> 01:18:57,834
I just came...

1146
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:00,709
