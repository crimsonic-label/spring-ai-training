"It is not chaos or death.

2
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,348
"It is form and union and plan.

3
00:02:11,653 --> 00:02:13,089
"It is eternal life.

"It is happiness.

5

"The past and present wilt.

"I have filled

00:02:19,661 --> 00:02:22,403
"and proceed to fill my

"Listener up there! What
have you to confide to me?

9
00:02:25,754 --> 00:02:28,587
"Look in my face while I
snuff the sidle of evening.

10
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:31,024
"Talk honestly, no
one else hears you,

11
00:02:31,107 --> 00:02:32,765

00:02:36,243 --> 00:02:37,683
"Very well then, I
contradict myself.

I am large, I
contain multitudes."

15
00:02:40,595 --> 00:02:41,770
My God.

16
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,251
What is it?

17
00:02:45,643 --> 00:02:47,776
Clearly something more
interesting than Whitman.

18
00:02:48,907 --> 00:02:51,523
California. There was
another earthquake.

19
00:02:51,606 --> 00:02:54,917
A huge chunk's gone from
Santa Barbara to Fresno.

20
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,484
-It's fucking crazy.
-Into the ocean.

21
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:58,367
-Just like that.
-Alright, alright.

22
00:02:58,613 --> 00:02:59,613
Settle down.

23
00:03:01,268 --> 00:03:02,229
Got no connection.

24
00:03:02,312 --> 00:03:03,792
Anybody else have one?

25
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:06,142
No.

26
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:14,502
Oh, eh, sorry.
Network's still down.

27
00:03:14,585 --> 00:03:16,239
I've got his file here, though.

28
00:03:16,935 --> 00:03:18,898
Uh, Dylan's been diving lately.

29
00:03:18,981 --> 00:03:20,465
I mean, this semester, he's gone

30
00:03:20,548 --> 00:03:22,815
from As and Bs to Ds.

31
00:03:22,898 --> 00:03:24,208
You keep hard copies?

32
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:25,731
When the network
started acting up,

33
00:03:25,814 --> 00:03:27,515
a lot of us started
keeping hard copies.

34
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:30,166
What do you think? I mean,
you think it's coming back?

35
00:03:30,645 --> 00:03:32,564
Well, I don't, I don't know.

36
00:03:32,647 --> 00:03:34,435
I remember the world
before the internet.

37
00:03:34,518 --> 00:03:35,915
Why is it so hard to imagine
carrying on without it?

38
00:03:35,998 --> 00:03:37,438
It is, though, isn't it?

39
00:03:37,521 --> 00:03:39,658
How do we go back?
How... Can we go back?

40
00:03:39,741 --> 00:03:41,442
What if it's down
for good this time?

41
00:03:41,525 --> 00:03:42,791
Internet's still down.

42
00:03:42,874 --> 00:03:44,228
Yeah, but lucky for us,

43
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:45,794
I've got hard copies
for each student.

44
00:03:45,877 --> 00:03:47,318
I think this might be it.

45
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:48,275
I don't think it's
coming back this time.

46
00:03:48,358 --> 00:03:49,972
You might be right.

47
00:03:50,055 --> 00:03:51,409
But I do think we
should talk about Emily.

48
00:03:51,492 --> 00:03:52,758
Her attendance has
really fallen off.

49
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:54,146
Her attendance?

50
00:03:54,495 --> 00:03:56,414
Absenteeism's at
an all-time high

51
00:03:56,497 --> 00:03:57,806
all over the world.

52
00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:00,809
We got doctors and
pilots and cops

53
00:04:00,892 --> 00:04:04,073
and everyone's just pissing
the fuck off, right?

54
00:04:04,156 --> 00:04:06,859
But you, you want to
talk to us about Emily?

55
00:04:06,942 --> 00:04:08,948
How are they supposed
to study, anyway?

56
00:04:09,031 --> 00:04:11,080
Web's been on the
fritz for eight months.

57
00:04:11,163 --> 00:04:13,862
Half those sites
are just garbled.

58
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,868
I mean, I get it, sites go dark.

59
00:04:15,951 --> 00:04:17,696
But what about all
that other stuff?

60
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:21,308
Like, sites are there, but
all the punctuation's wrong.

61
00:04:21,391 --> 00:04:24,264
Words spelled wrong.
How do you explain that?

62
00:04:25,743 --> 00:04:27,358
Well, I can't,

63
00:04:27,441 --> 00:04:30,491
but Brian can still
prepare for class.

64
00:04:30,574 --> 00:04:33,494
I mean, the library's still
here. Internet or not.

65
00:04:33,577 --> 00:04:34,796
Pornhub's down.

66
00:04:36,754 --> 00:04:38,060
Did you know that, Mr. Anderson?

67
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,373
Yeah, I, uh,

68
00:04:42,456 --> 00:04:45,372
I, I, I had noticed that. Yeah.

69
00:04:45,894 --> 00:04:47,639
Sorry if Bri's been any trouble.

70
00:04:47,722 --> 00:04:50,424
It's just me now. His mom...

71
00:04:50,507 --> 00:04:52,252
she left, I don't know where.

72
00:04:52,335 --> 00:04:53,906
That's been happening
a lot more I hear,

73
00:04:53,989 --> 00:04:55,773
people just ghosting.

74
00:04:56,731 --> 00:05:00,434
Hers was some star-crossed
boyfriend from high school.

75
00:05:00,517 --> 00:05:01,605
They dated a month.

76
00:05:03,215 --> 00:05:05,222
Goddamn month. She's
gonna throw 20 years

77
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,307
in the trash to
chase down a month.

78
00:05:09,047 --> 00:05:10,807
I guess she never stopped
thinking about him.

79
00:05:12,007 --> 00:05:13,708
I guess we've all got
someone like that.

80
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:17,234
I mean, I get it, if
it really is the end,

81
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,584
like those kooks in
the purple robes say,

82
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:21,930
then who do you want
to be with for it?

83
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:24,019
But to leave her son?

84
00:05:28,023 --> 00:05:29,416
Uh, she says she'll be back.

85
00:05:30,982 --> 00:05:33,028
I don't know. Um...

86
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:38,860
Fuckin' Pornhub.

87
00:05:40,122 --> 00:05:41,693
What if that never comes back?

88
00:05:41,776 --> 00:05:43,734
Fuckin' tragedy.

89
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:48,173
I mean, even if it is
the end of all things...

90
00:05:50,132 --> 00:05:51,525
that's just fuckin' mean.

91
00:05:57,922 --> 00:06:00,098
-Sorry.
-Yeah.

92
00:06:02,274 --> 00:06:03,628
It's a scene of devastation

93
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:05,369
and heartbreak in California,

94
00:06:05,452 --> 00:06:07,632
as rescue workers sift
through what remains

95
00:06:07,715 --> 00:06:09,286
of the northern
portion of the state.

96
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:12,158
Reporter 2:350 dead
in North Yorkshire

97
00:06:12,241 --> 00:06:13,507
as water levels continue to...

98
00:06:34,306 --> 00:06:35,703
The day Marty Anderson

99
00:06:35,786 --> 00:06:37,749
first saw the billboard

100
00:06:37,832 --> 00:06:41,056
was just before the internet
finally went down for good.

101
00:06:43,751 --> 00:06:46,192
It had been wobbling
for eight months,

102
00:06:46,275 --> 00:06:49,630
but other problems,
like fires, earthquakes,

103
00:06:49,713 --> 00:06:52,590
and whole species of
birds and fish dying off

104
00:06:52,673 --> 00:06:54,418
had taken priority.

105
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:56,202
...till today, thought to be

106
00:06:56,285 --> 00:06:57,899

United States history.

by way of the Turnpike bypass,

111
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:10,390
but that wasn't possible

112
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:12,044

of the bridge

that officially makes
Nevada one of the most

122
00:07:37,892 --> 00:07:39,680
populous states
in the Union now.

123
00:07:39,763 --> 00:07:41,334
The thing that must
be said here is...

124
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:43,336
Felicia Gordon is a nurse

125
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:44,946
at City General.

126
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:46,644
Though for the last few weeks,

127
00:07:46,727 --> 00:07:50,299
she's felt more
like an undertaker.

128
00:07:50,382 --> 00:07:53,302
The staff, whose numbers
have been dwindling

129
00:07:53,385 --> 00:07:55,870
since late summer,
have begun referring

130
00:07:55,953 --> 00:07:58,830
to themselves as
the Suicide Squad.

131
00:07:58,913 --> 00:08:00,745
We'll be back to
talk more about this

132
00:08:00,828 --> 00:08:02,877
and, uh, also about the
fires in the Midwest,

133
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,528
speaking of water scarcity,
back after this break.

134
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:12,017
We'd like to say thank you

135
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,714
to Charles Krantz

136
00:08:13,797 --> 00:08:16,717
for 39 great years.

137
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,845
Thanks, Chuck.

138
00:08:21,936 --> 00:08:23,024
Hey.

139
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:25,378
Heard you got another one.

140
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:27,075
Yeah. One more.

141
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:29,465
Mine wasn't so lucky.
Slit wrists, so...

142
00:08:30,292 --> 00:08:31,859
what were we supposed
to do really?

143
00:08:32,337 --> 00:08:33,952
Hear about Marilou?

144
00:08:34,035 --> 00:08:35,693
No. What about Marilou?

145
00:08:35,776 --> 00:08:36,907
She left!

146
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,566
-Her ex. Remember Pedro?
-Mm-hm.

147
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:41,525
He showed up, and I don't
know what he said to her,

148
00:08:41,608 --> 00:08:43,305
but she walked out
holding his hand.

149
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:45,877
And I remember how
bad that divorce was.

150
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,661
-Do you remember?
-Yeah, I remember.

151
00:08:47,744 --> 00:08:49,271
Well, I guess that's
all bridge water

152
00:08:49,354 --> 00:08:51,448
'cause off she went.

153
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,797
...sinkholes that
have been opening up.

154
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,276
I wonder what the stats are.

155
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:56,975
You think more people
are splitting up

156
00:08:57,058 --> 00:08:58,407
or getting back together?

157
00:08:58,755 --> 00:09:00,369
I mean, do you think
marriage rates are up

158
00:09:00,452 --> 00:09:01,772
-or divorce rates...
-Marriages.

159
00:09:02,977 --> 00:09:04,500
-You're an optimist.
-No.

160
00:09:05,632 --> 00:09:06,898
Divorce takes way longer,

161
00:09:06,981 --> 00:09:08,639
and I don't think
anyone's filing.

162
00:09:08,722 --> 00:09:10,684
Why bother? Six months
of paperwork at least.

163
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:11,859
Probably more.

164
00:09:11,942 --> 00:09:12,947
Marriage license is one page

165
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,249
and it takes an hour or so.

166
00:09:15,467 --> 00:09:17,513
I'm gonna guess marriages.

167
00:09:18,688 --> 00:09:20,215
Missed you for lunch,
missed you for dinner.

168
00:09:20,298 --> 00:09:21,869
What's the matter?
Don't you eat anymore?

169
00:09:21,952 --> 00:09:23,610
Well, I wasn't hungry tonight.

170
00:09:23,693 --> 00:09:25,177
Weren't you hungry
this morning either?

171
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,744
Who stole my nylons?

172
00:09:26,827 --> 00:09:30,182
Egads! The very... Not very.

173
00:09:30,265 --> 00:09:32,445
Too much rehearsal
last night, huh?

174
00:09:32,528 --> 00:09:33,881
It was kind of a workout.

175
00:09:33,964 --> 00:09:35,187
That why you slept late?

176
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,493
Oh, I didn't sleep late.

177
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,929
I went uptown.

178
00:09:38,012 --> 00:09:39,666
-Shopping?
-No.

179
00:09:42,712 --> 00:09:43,712
Hey.

180
00:09:45,672 --> 00:09:46,872
Hi.

181
00:09:49,327 --> 00:09:50,768
You hung up?

182
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:52,200
Yeah.

183
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:54,681
But then I figured you
probably saw it. So...

184
00:09:57,031 --> 00:09:58,032
How are you?

185
00:09:58,772 --> 00:10:00,604
Marty Anderson :
I'm okay, I guess.

186
00:10:00,687 --> 00:10:01,775
How are you?

187
00:10:02,514 --> 00:10:04,778
I was, um, thinking
about you today.

188
00:10:05,866 --> 00:10:07,828
We were at work talking
about marriages and divorces.

189
00:10:07,911 --> 00:10:09,395
Like, which are
happening more now...

190
00:10:09,478 --> 00:10:10,522
Marriages, I bet.

191
00:10:11,654 --> 00:10:13,221
Ain't nobody waiting
on a divorce.

192
00:10:14,265 --> 00:10:15,545
What about remarriages?

193
00:10:17,878 --> 00:10:19,361
You want to buy a guy
a drink first or...

194
00:10:19,444 --> 00:10:20,711
I bet those are happening.

195
00:10:20,794 --> 00:10:21,925
I mean, it makes sense.

196
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:25,494
People wanting something
comforting and...

197
00:10:26,364 --> 00:10:27,670
familiar.

198
00:10:28,976 --> 00:10:31,282
So... how was your day?

199
00:10:32,283 --> 00:10:34,111
You're just going right
for it, aren't you?

200
00:10:34,764 --> 00:10:35,809
Humor me.

201
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,462
It was, um...

202
00:10:38,072 --> 00:10:41,993
It was a day, I guess.

203
00:10:42,076 --> 00:10:44,687
You know? Weird.

204
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:46,388
Parent-teacher sessions,

205
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:48,909
felt like pissing in the wind.

206
00:10:49,561 --> 00:10:50,958
You know about
California, right?

207
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,786
Yeah.

208
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:54,396
I know they're saying most
of it was already evacuated,

209
00:10:54,479 --> 00:10:56,398
but I heard today there
are hundreds of thousands

210
00:10:56,481 --> 00:10:57,878
of refugees trekking east.

211
00:10:57,961 --> 00:10:59,184
Did you know Nevada
is one of the most

212
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:00,664
populous states
in the Union now?

213
00:11:00,747 --> 00:11:02,709
I heard a, a
scientist on NPR say

214
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:05,099
California is peeling
away like old wallpaper.

215
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:08,493
And another Japanese reactor
got inundated this afternoon.

216
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:11,152
And they're saying, you know,
it was shut down and all's well,

217
00:11:11,235 --> 00:11:13,154
but I just, I, I don't
think I believe that.

218
00:11:13,237 --> 00:11:15,374
Cynic.

219
00:11:15,457 --> 00:11:17,158
Well, we're living in
cynical times, Marty.

220
00:11:17,241 --> 00:11:20,505
I mean, some people think
we're living in the last times.

221
00:11:21,028 --> 00:11:23,121
Not just the religious
crazies either. Not anymore.

222
00:11:23,204 --> 00:11:25,819
And you are hearing that from
a member in good standing

223
00:11:25,902 --> 00:11:28,383
of the City General
Suicide Squad.

224
00:11:29,297 --> 00:11:30,519
That's what we
call ourselves now.

225
00:11:30,602 --> 00:11:32,039
No lie.

226
00:11:32,343 --> 00:11:35,089
We lost six today,
but there's 18 more

227
00:11:35,172 --> 00:11:36,830
we dragged back,
mostly with naloxone.

228
00:11:36,913 --> 00:11:38,440
But supplies of that
are getting very thin.

229
00:11:38,523 --> 00:11:40,399
And I heard the
head pharmacist say

230
00:11:40,482 --> 00:11:43,006
we might be completely out
by the end of the month.

231
00:11:43,877 --> 00:11:45,273
That sucks.

232
00:11:45,356 --> 00:11:47,097
Yeah. Yeah.

233
00:11:47,968 --> 00:11:49,752
Yeah, that sucks.
It, it really sucks.

234
00:11:52,233 --> 00:11:54,108
The internet's down,
and California's hanging

235
00:11:54,191 --> 00:11:55,414
by a thread.

236
00:11:55,497 --> 00:11:57,459
There's fires and famines

237
00:11:57,542 --> 00:11:58,591
and plagues and all the rest.

238
00:11:58,674 --> 00:11:59,940
I mean, it just

239
00:12:00,023 --> 00:12:01,285
the center doesn't hold.

240
00:12:03,157 --> 00:12:04,680
It just won't let up.

241
00:12:08,205 --> 00:12:09,946
How long is this gonna go on?

242
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,531
How much can we take
before the whole thing...

243
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,474
before the whole thing
goes apart, I mean.

244
00:12:21,828 --> 00:12:24,482
I'm teaching the kids
Carl Sagan right now.

245
00:12:26,658 --> 00:12:28,835
You ever hear what he said
about the cosmic calendar?

246
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,795
Uh... I don't know.
I don't think so.

247
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,281
Well, the universe is
15 billion years old.

248
00:12:36,364 --> 00:12:37,891
And if you took all of that,

249
00:12:37,974 --> 00:12:41,242
all, all 15 billion years

250
00:12:41,325 --> 00:12:45,333
and compress them into
a single calendar year,

251
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:48,989
then the Big Bang happens in
the first second, January 1st.

252
00:12:49,072 --> 00:12:50,900
And, and today,

253
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,908
oh, right now, we're in
the final millisecond

254
00:12:54,991 --> 00:12:56,732
of the last minute
of the last day,

255
00:12:57,341 --> 00:12:58,738
December 31st.

256
00:12:58,821 --> 00:13:00,697
But if you go back to the start,

257
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,221
if the, if the Big Bang happens

258
00:13:03,304 --> 00:13:05,088
at midnight, January 1st,

259
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:07,921
then each month of this calendar

260
00:13:08,004 --> 00:13:10,141
is one and a quarter
billion years long.

261
00:13:10,224 --> 00:13:12,447
Hey, nobody told me there
was math on this exam.

262
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:15,146
The universe
starts January 1st,

263
00:13:15,229 --> 00:13:18,018
but the, uh, the
Milky Way didn't form

264
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:19,581
until May.

265
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:21,456
Our sun and our earth,

266
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:25,108
they don't show up
until mid-September.

267
00:13:25,456 --> 00:13:27,676
Life appears soon
after. But not us.

268
00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:31,510
No. No, no, we don't
appear for guess how long?

269
00:13:31,593 --> 00:13:33,730
Again, I was told
there'd be no math.

270
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,031
December 31st.

271
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:37,690
Last day on the calendar,

272
00:13:37,773 --> 00:13:39,692
and the very first
human beings on Earth

273
00:13:39,775 --> 00:13:40,994
made their debut

274
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:43,213
around 10:30 p.m.

275
00:13:44,345 --> 00:13:47,348
10:30 p.m. on the last day.

276
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,442
And, um, every minute since then

277
00:13:50,525 --> 00:13:52,139
is 30,000 years.

278
00:13:52,222 --> 00:13:56,226
So, 11:46 p.m.,

279
00:13:56,923 --> 00:14:00,752
only 14 minutes ago,
humanity tamed fire

280
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:04,234
and now we're out of
minutes, we're into seconds.

281
00:14:05,932 --> 00:14:07,764
11:59 and 20 seconds,

282
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:11,676
the domestication of
plants and animals begin,

283
00:14:12,155 --> 00:14:14,941
an application for the human
talent for making tools.

284
00:14:15,942 --> 00:14:18,335
11:59 and 35 seconds,

285
00:14:19,293 --> 00:14:21,212
agricultural communities

286
00:14:21,295 --> 00:14:23,297
evolved into the first cities.

287
00:14:25,081 --> 00:14:26,343
Our recorded history,

288
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,259
everyone we've ever heard of,

289
00:14:29,781 --> 00:14:33,002
every single thing in any
one of our history books...

290
00:14:35,091 --> 00:14:36,832
happens in the last 10 seconds.

291
00:14:39,487 --> 00:14:41,054
The last 10 seconds

292
00:14:41,968 --> 00:14:43,230
of the last minute

293
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,885
of the last day on the calendar.

294
00:14:47,408 --> 00:14:48,888
December 31st.

295
00:14:53,849 --> 00:14:55,416
So how long is it gonna go on?

296
00:14:56,547 --> 00:14:57,897
I don't know, Fel.

297
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:01,121
If you're right,
and you might be,

298
00:15:01,204 --> 00:15:04,124
that this really is
the, the last times

299
00:15:04,207 --> 00:15:06,383
and the universe is dying,

300
00:15:07,036 --> 00:15:08,607
and let's just say
it's a fast death,

301
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,435
even if all of this
is happening in the,

302
00:15:10,518 --> 00:15:13,216
the last split second,

303
00:15:14,043 --> 00:15:15,349
microsecond,

304
00:15:16,002 --> 00:15:17,568
who knows how long that'll last.

305
00:15:18,178 --> 00:15:21,137
Maybe seconds, maybe eons.

306
00:15:21,442 --> 00:15:24,188
Maybe all this is happening
as the cosmos burps out

307
00:15:24,271 --> 00:15:25,533
its last breath.

308
00:15:27,883 --> 00:15:29,711
Maybe it's all
happening in the last

309
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,193
single solitary heartbeat.

310
00:15:38,111 --> 00:15:39,547
Jesus, Marty.

311
00:15:42,158 --> 00:15:43,246
Yeah.

312
00:15:49,731 --> 00:15:51,559
Listen, Fel, I should
go. I've, um...

313
00:15:53,865 --> 00:15:55,911
I've got tests to grade.

314
00:15:57,652 --> 00:15:58,652
Marty...

315
00:16:00,611 --> 00:16:01,878
the world is going
down the drain,

316
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,575
and all we can say
is, "That sucks."

317
00:16:03,658 --> 00:16:06,661
So, maybe we're going
down the drain too.

318
00:16:07,618 --> 00:16:09,098
Maybe.

319
00:16:09,446 --> 00:16:11,670
But, you know, Chuck
Krantz is retiring.

320
00:16:11,753 --> 00:16:13,411
So...

321
00:16:13,494 --> 00:16:16,066
...I guess there's a gleam
of light in the darkness.

322
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:17,763
Yes. Thirty-nine great years.

323
00:16:17,846 --> 00:16:19,373
Oh, you saw that
weird billboard?

324
00:16:19,456 --> 00:16:21,375
No, it was an ad on
the radio that, um,

325
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,290
that NPR show I was
telling you about.

326
00:16:23,373 --> 00:16:24,857
If they're running ads on NPR,

327
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:25,684
it really is the
end of the world.

328
00:16:27,073 --> 00:16:28,687
Tell me, how does Chuck Krantz

329
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,558
rate this kind of coverage?

330
00:16:30,641 --> 00:16:33,083
I mean... looks
like an accountant.

331
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,297
I've never heard of him.

332
00:16:35,385 --> 00:16:37,130
Used an old photo too, I guess.

333
00:16:37,213 --> 00:16:39,002
I mean, the guy barely
looks 40 at all,

334
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:41,352
let alone 40 years on the job.

335
00:16:41,435 --> 00:16:43,089
The world is full of mysteries.

336
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,702
And, hey, no hard stuff, Marty.

337
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,617
Okay? Have a beer instead.

338
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,186
You got it.

339
00:16:57,146 --> 00:16:58,978
The Ohio EPA has now issued

340
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:00,719
a code red air quality alert

341
00:17:00,802 --> 00:17:02,373
for Cleveland and
its surrounding...

342
00:17:27,524 --> 00:17:30,575
Oh, shit on a stick.

343
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:36,668
We'd like to say thank you

344
00:17:36,751 --> 00:17:38,061
to Charles Krantz

345
00:17:38,144 --> 00:17:41,151
for 39 great years.

346
00:17:41,234 --> 00:17:42,800
Thanks, Chuck.

347
00:18:10,437 --> 00:18:11,437
Gus!

348
00:18:12,613 --> 00:18:14,658
Oh. Hey, Marty.

349
00:18:15,311 --> 00:18:16,530
Where's your car?

350
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:18,710
It's... it's on,

351
00:18:18,793 --> 00:18:20,146
it's on the sidewalk
halfway down

352
00:18:20,229 --> 00:18:22,235
Main Street Hill with
a hundred others.

353
00:18:22,318 --> 00:18:23,802
I finally just had
to turn around.

354
00:18:23,885 --> 00:18:25,630
Fuck it, I walked...

355
00:18:25,713 --> 00:18:27,153
What do you think it
is, like, three miles?

356
00:18:27,236 --> 00:18:28,759
I just walked three miles.

357
00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:31,331
Oh, you're going to
school. Hold on a sec.

358
00:18:31,414 --> 00:18:35,161
Uh, real quick, you
gotta, you gotta go,

359
00:18:35,244 --> 00:18:37,163
listen to me, you
gotta go out Route 11

360
00:18:37,246 --> 00:18:39,513
and then hook back
on, on, on 19.

361
00:18:39,596 --> 00:18:41,776
Yeah. There's gonna
be plenty of traffic.

362
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:43,256
You gotta go out
at least 20 miles.

363
00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:44,736
You might make it before lunch.

364
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:47,173
-I wouldn't count on it.
-What happened?

365
00:18:47,256 --> 00:18:49,393
Giant sinkhole opened
up on Market and Main.

366
00:18:49,476 --> 00:18:51,482
Man, the-the thing,
it, uh, it's huge.

367
00:18:51,565 --> 00:18:53,745
All the rain probably had
something to do with it,

368
00:18:53,828 --> 00:18:55,529
lack of maintenance
maybe more so.

369
00:18:55,612 --> 00:18:57,836
But it's not my
department, thank God.

370
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,573
But, yeah, there's,
there's gotta be

371
00:19:00,269 --> 00:19:01,883
20 cars at the bottom.

372
00:19:01,966 --> 00:19:03,711
And some of the people
in some of those cars,

373
00:19:03,794 --> 00:19:05,278
they ain't comin' back.

374
00:19:05,361 --> 00:19:07,407
Jesus, I was, I was
just there last night,

375
00:19:08,234 --> 00:19:09,674
backed up in traffic.

376
00:19:09,757 --> 00:19:11,357
Thank God you weren't
there this morning.

377
00:19:12,542 --> 00:19:13,978
I assume you know
about California.

378
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,768
I didn't turn on
the TV this morning.

379
00:19:16,851 --> 00:19:17,986
-Oh!
-Is there something new?

380
00:19:18,069 --> 00:19:19,680
The, the rest of it went.

381
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:23,601
I-I mean, th-they're saying
that 20% of Northern California

382
00:19:23,684 --> 00:19:26,256
is hanging in there, which
probably means, what, 10%?

383
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:28,993
But the food-producing
regions are... they're gone.

384
00:19:30,517 --> 00:19:32,131
And with the Midwest
turning to charcoal

385
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:33,828
and Florida
flooding, that's like

386
00:19:33,911 --> 00:19:35,696
all the food-producing regions

387
00:19:36,305 --> 00:19:38,311
in the country just gone.

388
00:19:38,394 --> 00:19:39,704
And the same thing with Europe.

389
00:19:39,787 --> 00:19:41,271
I mean, it's famine
time in Asia.

390
00:19:41,354 --> 00:19:42,707
There's a million people dead.

391
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,361
They're saying it's
the bub-bublonic,

392
00:19:44,444 --> 00:19:45,536
-bubonic plague.
-Bubonic.

393
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:47,494
Bu-Bubonic plague. Yeah.

394
00:19:47,577 --> 00:19:49,801
And the bees, I mean, they
were in trouble a decade ago,

395
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:51,281
but they're completely gone now.

396
00:19:51,364 --> 00:19:52,499
I mean, there's a couple
of hives or whatever

397
00:19:52,582 --> 00:19:53,979
down in South America,

398
00:19:54,062 --> 00:19:55,894
but there ain't no honey, honey.

399
00:19:55,977 --> 00:19:58,244
And without those little guys,
like, what's gonna pollinate

400
00:19:58,327 --> 00:19:59,680
all the crops we have left?

401
00:19:59,763 --> 00:20:00,725
I mean, I can't do...

402
00:20:00,808 --> 00:20:02,074
Excuse me. One sec.

403
00:20:02,157 --> 00:20:03,380
Yeah, yeah. That's-that's cool.

404
00:20:03,463 --> 00:20:05,251
A-Andrea? Are you,

405
00:20:05,334 --> 00:20:07,123
are you Andrea
from Midwest Trust?

406
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,168
I'm Felicia Anderson's husband.

407
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:11,344
Ex, actually.

408
00:20:11,427 --> 00:20:12,867
I think you and Fel
know each other.

409
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,652
We met at a, a, a
game night at David's.

410
00:20:14,735 --> 00:20:16,476
-A few game nights.
-Yeah, sure.

411
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,478
What do you want?

412
00:20:18,826 --> 00:20:21,006
I just had a long walk,
and my car is stuck,

413
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:22,482
and the bank is,

414
00:20:23,047 --> 00:20:24,048
it's leaning.

415
00:20:25,441 --> 00:20:26,442
Leaning?

416
00:20:27,008 --> 00:20:28,052
Yeah.

417
00:20:28,531 --> 00:20:29,924
It's on the edge
of the sinkhole.

418
00:20:31,447 --> 00:20:32,931
Guess that's the end of my job.

419
00:20:33,014 --> 00:20:34,585
Hey, I'm curious
about the billboard

420
00:20:34,668 --> 00:20:36,108
on the bank building.

421
00:20:36,191 --> 00:20:37,414
-Have you seen it?
-How could I miss it?

422
00:20:37,497 --> 00:20:40,456
And I saw the ads too, on TV.

423
00:20:40,891 --> 00:20:43,159
No more ads for cars
or discount furniture.

424
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,378
Just, "Charles Krantz,

425
00:20:45,461 --> 00:20:47,902
39 great years. Thanks, Chuck."

426
00:20:47,985 --> 00:20:49,469
So, he doesn't
work at the bank?

427
00:20:49,552 --> 00:20:52,080
He's not retiring from the bank?

428
00:20:52,163 --> 00:20:54,035
I don't know Charles Krantz.

429
00:20:55,123 --> 00:20:57,386
I think it's just a
prank. Performance art.

430
00:20:59,954 --> 00:21:00,955
Take care.

431
00:21:07,831 --> 00:21:09,311
They look like refugees.

432
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:11,531
Yeah.

433
00:21:13,924 --> 00:21:15,491
No one looks that concerned.

434
00:21:16,405 --> 00:21:18,106
What good would that do?

435
00:21:18,189 --> 00:21:19,974
All was concerned at the start.

436
00:21:20,714 --> 00:21:22,459
Remember the protests?
You remember...

437
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:24,330
they knocked over the
fence at the White House,

438
00:21:24,413 --> 00:21:26,245
and all those students got shot?

439
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:27,986
-Yeah.
-And the overthrow of the Russian government.

440
00:21:28,069 --> 00:21:30,597
You got the Four Day War
between Pakistan and India

441
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:35,511
and the fucking... the
volcano in Germany.

442
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:38,993
There was a volcano in
Germany. That's, that's crazy.

443
00:21:39,472 --> 00:21:41,913
And we just kept saying,
"Oh, it's gonna blow over."

444
00:21:41,996 --> 00:21:44,172
That doesn't look to be
happening, though, does it?

445
00:21:47,044 --> 00:21:48,398
No.

446
00:21:48,481 --> 00:21:50,744
I think that suicides
will slow down.

447
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:56,402
I think people
will just... wait.

448
00:21:58,926 --> 00:22:00,319
For what?

449
00:22:01,102 --> 00:22:02,146
The end.

450
00:22:04,888 --> 00:22:06,281
This is the end of everything.

451
00:22:08,196 --> 00:22:09,636
I mean, we're,
we're going through

452
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:11,029
the five stages of grief.

453
00:22:11,112 --> 00:22:12,596
Don't you get it?
I mean, we just,

454
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:14,855
we just landed on
the final stage.

455
00:22:15,464 --> 00:22:16,596
Acceptance.

456
00:22:18,598 --> 00:22:19,642
The waiting...

457
00:22:22,253 --> 00:22:23,690
I think that's the hardest part.

458
00:22:25,822 --> 00:22:28,568
And the whole thing, it just,
it-it came out of nowhere, right?

459
00:22:28,651 --> 00:22:31,223
I mean, everyone knew there was
trouble with the environment.

460
00:22:31,306 --> 00:22:33,312
I mean, I think even
the right-wing nutjobs

461
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:34,748
were secretly, they got it.

462
00:22:34,831 --> 00:22:36,224
But this...

463
00:22:37,834 --> 00:22:38,966
this...

464
00:22:39,532 --> 00:22:44,885
this is just 60 different
varieties of shit.

465
00:22:45,451 --> 00:22:48,454
It's just so much shit
that happened fast.

466
00:22:48,932 --> 00:22:51,370
It's like a year,
man. Fourteen months.

467
00:22:53,197 --> 00:22:54,808
Sucks.

468
00:22:59,639 --> 00:23:02,341
Yeah. Sucks.

469
00:23:05,601 --> 00:23:06,601
Huh.

470
00:23:07,168 --> 00:23:08,343
Skywriting.

471
00:23:11,607 --> 00:23:14,044
I haven't seen one of
those since I was a kid.

472
00:23:16,482 --> 00:23:17,613
Oh.

473
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,355
What the fuck?

474
00:23:22,096 --> 00:23:25,839
My sentiments... exactly.

475
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,358
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
where have you been?

476
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,616
Are you kidding?

477
00:24:04,051 --> 00:24:05,665
I had to run here.

478
00:24:05,748 --> 00:24:08,712
The traffic's insane, and
half the cars are empty.

479
00:24:08,795 --> 00:24:09,843
Dr. Winston's MIA.

480
00:24:09,926 --> 00:24:11,541
-What?
-Yeah.

481
00:24:11,624 --> 00:24:12,846
He walked in this morning,
and he looked around

482
00:24:12,929 --> 00:24:13,891
and he walked out again.

483
00:24:13,974 --> 00:24:15,414
And now I can't find him.

484
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:17,057
He dropped his pager
when he walked out.

485
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,679
Okay. I'll scrub in.

486
00:24:19,762 --> 00:24:21,068
The beds are empty.

487
00:24:22,112 --> 00:24:23,596
Most of them walked
out. I-I-I transferred

488
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,250
the last of the stable ones.

489
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:27,992
But, Felicia, there's
something weird.

490
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:32,471
What is that?

491
00:24:45,266 --> 00:24:46,789
What's wrong with the monitor?

492
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,488
That's the thing, it-it's,
it's not just that one.

493
00:25:14,643 --> 00:25:17,254
I don't know, Fel. I don't know.

494
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:21,258
I mean... I might want
to get out of here.

495
00:25:22,608 --> 00:25:24,788
I might wanna go home.

496
00:25:24,871 --> 00:25:26,180
I don't think I need
to be here anymore.

497
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:12,805
You okay, sir?

498
00:27:13,719 --> 00:27:16,029
Yeah. Just taking a rest.

499
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,817
I walked downtown to
look at the sinkhole

500
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,862
and take a few
pictures with my phone.

501
00:27:22,945 --> 00:27:26,213
Thought one of the local TV
stations might be interested,

502
00:27:26,296 --> 00:27:29,517
but they all seem
to be off the air.

503
00:27:30,561 --> 00:27:32,346
Except for pictures of Krantz.

504
00:27:34,565 --> 00:27:37,220
All Krantz all the time.

505
00:27:38,482 --> 00:27:40,354
-Any idea who he is?
-None.

506
00:27:41,311 --> 00:27:46,582
I've asked two dozen people,
at least. Nobody knows.

507
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:51,064
Our man, Krantz, is the
Oz of the apocalypse.

508
00:27:51,147 --> 00:27:53,236
Our last meme.

509
00:27:53,933 --> 00:27:56,243
-Where are you heading?
-Harvest Acres.

510
00:27:56,326 --> 00:27:58,328
Nice little enclave
off the beaten track.

511
00:27:59,634 --> 00:28:00,896
I'm heading there myself.

512
00:28:02,071 --> 00:28:03,468
-My ex lives there.
-Huh.

513
00:28:03,551 --> 00:28:04,817
Well...

514
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,180
I can walk with you if you like.

515
00:28:07,468 --> 00:28:08,643
What do you do, Sam?

516
00:28:09,557 --> 00:28:11,211
If you still do
anything, I mean.

517
00:28:12,995 --> 00:28:16,176
Owner and chief undertaker
for Yarborough Funeral Home.

518
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:17,917
Oh, man!

519
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,179
Yeah.

520
00:28:19,262 --> 00:28:21,617
We had a boom.

521
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,922
It's hard to feel good about it,

522
00:28:23,005 --> 00:28:24,141
but business was never better

523
00:28:24,224 --> 00:28:25,660
than it was a few weeks ago.

524
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:31,535
But my real interest's
meteorology.

525
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:35,195
Dreamed of being a
television weatherman

526
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:37,628
in my salad days, maybe
even one of the networks.

527
00:28:38,804 --> 00:28:40,327
But n-no.

528
00:28:41,067 --> 00:28:42,242
I keep up, though.

529
00:28:42,982 --> 00:28:44,248
Read the journals.

530
00:28:45,549 --> 00:28:47,073
And I can tell you

531
00:28:47,856 --> 00:28:50,210
something amazing
if you want to hear.

532
00:28:52,121 --> 00:28:55,734
You know how people say
there are 24 hours in a day?

533
00:28:57,126 --> 00:28:58,258
Well, they're wrong.

534
00:28:59,085 --> 00:29:02,483
There were 23 hours
and 56 minutes

535
00:29:02,566 --> 00:29:03,742
in a stellar day.

536
00:29:11,532 --> 00:29:13,229
Plus a few odd seconds.

537
00:29:13,534 --> 00:29:15,018
There "were"?

538
00:29:15,101 --> 00:29:18,021
Based on my calculations,
which I assure you

539
00:29:18,104 --> 00:29:19,932
I can back up, my math is good,

540
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:25,807
there are now 24 hours
and two minutes in a day.

541
00:29:26,416 --> 00:29:28,205
Do you know what that means?

542
00:29:28,288 --> 00:29:30,381
Well, you're saying the Earth's
rotation is slowing down?

543
00:29:30,464 --> 00:29:31,726
Exactly.

544
00:29:33,075 --> 00:29:35,299
Lot of folks think
all of these disasters

545
00:29:35,382 --> 00:29:37,127
are 'cause of what we've
done to the environment.

546
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:39,346
Not so.

547
00:29:39,429 --> 00:29:42,567
I'm the first to admit,
we treated our mother,

548
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:45,609
yes, she's our mother,
all of us, very badly.

549
00:29:46,436 --> 00:29:48,874
Certainly molested her,
if not outright raped her.

550
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,403
But... we're puny

551
00:29:52,486 --> 00:29:55,619
compared to the great
clock of the universe.

552
00:29:56,882 --> 00:29:57,883
No.

553
00:29:58,361 --> 00:29:59,493
Whatever's happening

554
00:30:00,015 --> 00:30:02,975
is much larger than
environmental degradation.

555
00:30:03,889 --> 00:30:05,107
The math says so.

556
00:30:06,587 --> 00:30:09,068
And, and math can
do a lot of things.

557
00:30:09,546 --> 00:30:11,635
I mean, math can be art...

558
00:30:13,115 --> 00:30:14,247
but it can't lie.

559
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,346
You know what?

560
00:30:22,429 --> 00:30:24,257
I think I'll sit

561
00:30:25,258 --> 00:30:27,173
and enjoy the sunset

562
00:30:27,738 --> 00:30:30,963
while I wait for the arthritis

563
00:30:31,046 --> 00:30:32,569
to settle a bit.

564
00:30:32,961 --> 00:30:34,006
You care to join me?

565
00:30:39,228 --> 00:30:40,273
I think I'll go on.

566
00:30:41,491 --> 00:30:44,760
The ex. I understand.

567
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:48,194
Well, it was nice speaking
with you, Mr. Anderson.

568
00:31:30,366 --> 00:31:31,367
Hey.

569
00:31:32,194 --> 00:31:33,326
Hey.

570
00:31:34,066 --> 00:31:36,724
Don't worry. I'm going
to see my ex-wife,

571
00:31:36,807 --> 00:31:38,157
Felicia Anderson.

572
00:31:39,201 --> 00:31:41,290
I think she's back
to Gordon now.

573
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,902
She lives on Fern
Lane, number 19.

574
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:46,948
Yeah, I know Miss Gordon.

575
00:31:48,863 --> 00:31:50,082
What are you doing out?

576
00:31:51,605 --> 00:31:53,128
I wanted to go skating.

577
00:31:55,826 --> 00:31:57,089
I used to love skating.

578
00:31:58,655 --> 00:31:59,918
Then you should go skating.

579
00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:04,448
Maybe I should.

580
00:32:04,531 --> 00:32:06,402
Why do you see Miss
Gordon if she's your ex?

581
00:32:08,622 --> 00:32:09,840
I still like her.

582
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,886
Do you fight?

583
00:32:13,148 --> 00:32:14,236
We used to.

584
00:32:16,064 --> 00:32:17,983
We get along better
now that we're exes.

585
00:32:18,066 --> 00:32:20,851
Miss Gordon gives us
gingersnap cookies sometimes.

586
00:32:21,765 --> 00:32:24,076
I like Oreos better, but...

587
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,687
That's just the way the
cookie crumbles, right?

588
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,211
Gingersnaps don't crumble.

589
00:32:28,294 --> 00:32:29,386
At least not until
you crunch them...

590
00:32:40,219 --> 00:32:41,655
You better go home, I guess.

591
00:32:44,571 --> 00:32:47,443
It's too dark for skating
without streetlights.

592
00:32:48,923 --> 00:32:52,231
Is everything gonna be okay?

593
00:32:54,885 --> 00:32:56,104
Sure it is.

594
00:33:31,139 --> 00:33:32,532
Go home.

595
00:33:33,663 --> 00:33:35,839
Go home to your Mom and Dad.

596
00:33:38,146 --> 00:33:39,626
Do it now.

597
00:34:13,138 --> 00:34:14,138
Huh?

598
00:34:19,405 --> 00:34:21,929
Oh, thank God. Oh, thank God.

599
00:34:22,843 --> 00:34:24,588
-Thank God.
-They, they just...

600
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,029
They just, they just
started showing up.

601
00:34:31,112 --> 00:34:32,548
No, I know, I know, I saw.

602
00:34:33,897 --> 00:34:35,116
Is it just here?

603
00:34:35,986 --> 00:34:37,292
I think it's everywhere.

604
00:34:39,903 --> 00:34:42,297
I think it's almost...

605
00:34:46,997 --> 00:34:47,998
Yeah...

606
00:34:49,174 --> 00:34:50,523
Yeah, I think it's almost...

607
00:36:32,277 --> 00:36:34,540
It's the brightest I've
ever seen the stars.

608
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,025
Just look at that.

609
00:36:44,419 --> 00:36:47,165
There's Aquila the eagle.

610
00:36:47,248 --> 00:36:48,248
Mm-hm.

611
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,251
There's, uh...

612
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:53,950
Cygnus the swan.

613
00:37:01,523 --> 00:37:02,742
You see it?

614
00:37:16,669 --> 00:37:17,974
And there's the North Sta...

615
00:37:22,327 --> 00:37:23,415
Did you just see that?

616
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,765
Yeah.

617
00:37:31,423 --> 00:37:33,033
There goes Mars.

618
00:37:48,527 --> 00:37:49,832
I'm scared.

619
00:37:53,445 --> 00:37:54,707
I am too.

620
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,709
It's okay, honey.

621
00:37:59,102 --> 00:38:00,147
You go on.

622
00:38:02,932 --> 00:38:04,499
You go on ahead, okay?

623
00:38:10,897 --> 00:38:13,552
Just thirty-nine years.

624
00:38:20,341 --> 00:38:22,129
Thirty-nine great years.

625
00:38:30,395 --> 00:38:31,787
Thanks, Chuck.

I love y...

631
00:39:23,709 --> 00:39:25,758
With the help of
her friend, Mac,

632
00:39:25,841 --> 00:39:27,412
who has an old van,

633
00:39:27,495 --> 00:39:30,110
Taylor Franck sets
up her drum kit

634
00:39:30,193 --> 00:39:31,590
in her favored spot

635
00:39:31,673 --> 00:39:34,201
on the Eighth Street Promenade.

636
00:39:37,113 --> 00:39:39,119
It's Thursday afternoon.

637
00:39:39,202 --> 00:39:42,079
The weather is fucking gorgeous,

638
00:39:42,162 --> 00:39:43,863
and the streets are
thronged with people

639
00:39:43,946 --> 00:39:46,039
looking forward to the weekend,

640
00:39:46,122 --> 00:39:48,999
which is always better
than the weekend itself.

641
00:39:49,082 --> 00:39:51,127
-All good. Taylor?
-Yeah, thanks.

642
00:39:51,563 --> 00:39:53,565
Ten percent is all the
thanks I want, dude.

643
00:39:54,609 --> 00:39:56,833
Taylor, and Mac too,

644
00:39:56,916 --> 00:39:58,443
work part-time

645
00:39:58,526 --> 00:40:00,615
at Doctor Records
on Castle Street.

646
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,882
But on a good day...

647
00:40:02,965 --> 00:40:05,145
...Taylor can make
almost as much busking.

648
00:40:07,317 --> 00:40:10,368
Busk-drumming isn't what
her parents saw for her

649
00:40:10,451 --> 00:40:12,805
when she enrolled at Juilliard,

650
00:40:12,888 --> 00:40:15,456
and they don't know yet
that she dropped out.

651
00:40:16,457 --> 00:40:19,682
Juilliard wanted you to think
about what you were doing,

652
00:40:19,765 --> 00:40:22,772
but as far as
Taylor is concerned,

653
00:40:22,855 --> 00:40:27,167
the beat is your friend
and thinking is the enemy.

654
00:40:32,691 --> 00:40:36,438
She starts warming up,
going easy at first.

655
00:40:36,521 --> 00:40:38,784
Slow tempo, no cowbell,

656
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,444
not minding that the
magic hat stays empty

657
00:40:42,527 --> 00:40:44,533
except for her two
crumpled dollars

658
00:40:44,616 --> 00:40:46,796
and a quarter flipped
contemptuously

659
00:40:46,879 --> 00:40:48,580
by a dude on a skateboard.

660
00:40:50,404 --> 00:40:53,625
There is time.
There is a way in.

661
00:40:54,234 --> 00:40:57,019
Finding the in is half the fun.

662
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,374
Maybe even most of it.

663
00:41:01,371 --> 00:41:04,117
Janice Halliday
is on her way home

664
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,207
from seven hours
at Paper and Page,

665
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:09,336
and may walk all the
way to the ocean.

666
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:14,040
Her boyfriend of 16 months
just broke up with her,

667
00:41:14,123 --> 00:41:16,391
and he did it the modern way.

668
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,914
Motherfucker!

669
00:41:17,997 --> 00:41:19,524
It was totally unexpected,

670
00:41:19,607 --> 00:41:22,309
like having a door
slammed in your face

671
00:41:22,392 --> 00:41:24,525
just as you were getting
ready to walk through it.

672
00:41:25,047 --> 00:41:26,531
-It was...
-Fucking bullshit!

673
00:41:26,614 --> 00:41:28,098
...fucking bullshit.

674
00:41:28,181 --> 00:41:29,926
She isn't in love with him.

675
00:41:30,009 --> 00:41:32,363
Never even kidded
herself that she was.

676
00:41:32,446 --> 00:41:34,234
-But still it...
-Fucking sucks.

677
00:41:34,317 --> 00:41:36,668
...is a dismaying
shock just the same.

678
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:39,936
She supposes she'll
have some wine

679
00:41:40,019 --> 00:41:41,673
when she gets home and cry.

680
00:41:42,674 --> 00:41:45,332
Maybe queue up one of
her big band playlists

681
00:41:45,415 --> 00:41:47,417
and dance drunk around the room.

682
00:41:48,114 --> 00:41:50,508
She loved to dance
in high school.

683
00:41:50,899 --> 00:41:53,732
Maybe she can recapture a
little of that happiness.

684
00:41:53,815 --> 00:41:56,126
-Fucking really?!
-Excuse me.

685
00:41:56,209 --> 00:41:58,516
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
Not you, not you.

686
00:41:59,342 --> 00:42:00,957
Fuck!

687
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,521
Got an oat milk
latte for Chuck.

688
00:42:04,478 --> 00:42:05,958
Charles Krantz,

689
00:42:06,785 --> 00:42:08,225
Chuck to his friends,

690
00:42:08,308 --> 00:42:11,271
is dressed in the
armor of accountancy.

691
00:42:11,354 --> 00:42:14,575
Gray suit, blue shirt, blue tie.

692
00:42:14,967 --> 00:42:19,014
His Samuel Windsor shoes
are inexpensive but sturdy.

693
00:42:19,972 --> 00:42:22,326
He's here for a
week-long conference

694
00:42:22,409 --> 00:42:25,804
titled "Banking in
the 21st Century."

695
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:29,899
He's been sent by his
bank, Midwest Trust,

696
00:42:29,982 --> 00:42:31,374
all expenses paid.

697
00:42:31,897 --> 00:42:35,687
Chuck has enjoyed the
speakers and the panels.

698
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:37,254
He was on one panel

699
00:42:37,337 --> 00:42:39,343
and is scheduled
to be on another

700
00:42:39,426 --> 00:42:42,302
before the conference
ends at noon tomorrow,

701
00:42:42,385 --> 00:42:45,480
but has no wish to
spend his off-duty hours

702
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:48,261
in the company of 70
other accountants.

703
00:42:48,783 --> 00:42:50,441
He speaks their language,

704
00:42:50,524 --> 00:42:53,309
but likes to think he
speaks others as well.

705
00:42:54,136 --> 00:42:55,794
At least he did,

706
00:42:55,877 --> 00:42:58,576
although some of the
vocabulary is now lost.

707
00:42:59,968 --> 00:43:03,019
Now, his sensible
Samuel Windsor Oxfords

708
00:43:03,102 --> 00:43:05,626
are taking him for
an afternoon walk.

709
00:43:06,018 --> 00:43:07,806
His life is narrower

710
00:43:07,889 --> 00:43:09,982
than the one he once hoped for,

711
00:43:10,065 --> 00:43:11,676
but he's made peace with that.

712
00:43:12,459 --> 00:43:14,421
He understands that narrowing

713
00:43:14,504 --> 00:43:16,681
is the natural order of things.

714
00:43:17,812 --> 00:43:19,514
He has a wife, Ginny,

715
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:22,342
to whom he is
scrupulously faithful,

716
00:43:22,425 --> 00:43:24,736
and an intelligent,
good-humored son

717
00:43:24,819 --> 00:43:25,864
in middle school.

718
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,524
He also has only
nine months to live,

719
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,526
though he doesn't know that yet.

720
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,795
Taylor has been on the
job for 10 minutes now

721
00:43:39,878 --> 00:43:41,967
and has nothing to show for it.

722
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:47,150
She sees a Mr. Businessman type

723
00:43:47,233 --> 00:43:48,847
coming toward her

724
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:51,371
and something about
him, God knows what,

725
00:43:51,454 --> 00:43:54,762
makes Taylor want to
announce his approach.

726
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:59,031
She slips first
into a reggae beat,

727
00:43:59,114 --> 00:44:00,855
then something slinkier.

728
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:05,298
And for the first time
today, Taylor feels a spark

729
00:44:05,381 --> 00:44:08,471
and begins to whack the
cowbell on the downbeat.

730
00:44:09,255 --> 00:44:10,560
It's pretty cool.

731
00:44:11,126 --> 00:44:13,742
The groove has arrived,

732
00:44:13,825 --> 00:44:17,437
and the groove is like a
road you want to follow.

733
00:44:17,916 --> 00:44:21,619
She could speed the beat
up, get some tom in there,

734
00:44:21,702 --> 00:44:23,969
but she's watching
Mr. Businessman

735
00:44:24,052 --> 00:44:26,098
and that seems
wrong for this dude.

736
00:44:27,186 --> 00:44:31,020
She believes Mr. Businessman
will just go on past

737
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:33,631
on his way to the
business hotel,

738
00:44:33,714 --> 00:44:35,241
and when he's gone,

739
00:44:35,324 --> 00:44:37,370
Taylor will switch
to something else.

740
00:44:39,894 --> 00:44:43,032
But instead of floating on by...

741
00:46:13,945 --> 00:46:15,033
Woo!

742
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,047
Yeah!

743
00:46:57,031 --> 00:46:59,251
Woo!

744
00:47:00,948 --> 00:47:01,948
Come on.

745
00:47:03,472 --> 00:47:04,517
Come on, little sister.

746
00:47:05,605 --> 00:47:06,653
Let's dance.

747
00:47:06,736 --> 00:47:08,264
Dance.

748
00:47:11,611 --> 00:47:13,443
Yeah!

749
00:47:13,526 --> 00:47:15,658
I'll lead you. I got you.

750
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:05,665
Uh.

751
00:48:10,626 --> 00:48:13,891
It's okay. It's my
glasses. It's my glasses.

752
00:49:54,861 --> 00:49:55,993
What are we doing?

753
00:49:56,776 --> 00:49:57,820
I don't know.

754
00:50:14,707 --> 00:50:16,230
No more today, folks.

755
00:50:16,883 --> 00:50:18,102
No more today.

756
00:50:18,841 --> 00:50:20,891
No more today. We gotta
quit while we're ahead.

757
00:50:24,543 --> 00:50:26,288
Do you need a-any
help at all or...

758
00:50:26,371 --> 00:50:27,811
Here, can you, uh, take this?

759
00:50:27,894 --> 00:50:29,421
-Sure.
-Just, just spin the thingy here.

760
00:50:29,504 --> 00:50:31,467
But watch out for your fingers.

761
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:33,295
It'll, it'll, it'll get 'em
good, you know what I mean?

762
00:50:33,378 --> 00:50:35,514
Yeah, yeah.

763
00:50:35,597 --> 00:50:37,690
What just happened?

764
00:50:37,773 --> 00:50:39,692
That was incredible.

765
00:50:39,775 --> 00:50:41,129
You dance for a living?

766
00:50:41,212 --> 00:50:42,869
No. Oh, no. I...

767
00:50:42,952 --> 00:50:44,871
-No, I do not, sir.
-What do you do for a living?

768
00:50:44,954 --> 00:50:46,786
Oh, no, I think I... Did I...
I didn't break it, did I?

769
00:50:46,869 --> 00:50:48,349
I think he broke, I
think he broke it.

770
00:50:50,308 --> 00:50:51,835
Let's hit the pond.

771
00:50:51,918 --> 00:50:53,659
We'll never find
parking by the Common.

772
00:50:54,529 --> 00:50:55,574
We will today.

773
00:50:56,923 --> 00:50:57,924
Today...

774
00:50:59,491 --> 00:51:00,622
is magic.

775
00:51:05,671 --> 00:51:07,191
Where did you learn
to dance like that?

776
00:51:15,159 --> 00:51:17,339
Oh, no, no, no, that's yours.

777
00:51:17,422 --> 00:51:18,949
Nope, we split it even.

778
00:51:19,032 --> 00:51:20,124
By myself, I wouldn't
have made half as much

779
00:51:20,207 --> 00:51:21,287
if I drummed till midnight.

780
00:51:32,437 --> 00:51:33,612
You okay?

781
00:51:35,657 --> 00:51:36,789
Yeah.

782
00:51:38,921 --> 00:51:40,706
Yeah. Just one of my headaches.

783
00:51:43,361 --> 00:51:45,758
Oh, no, no, no. Come on. I
don't need it. You keep it.

784
00:51:45,841 --> 00:51:47,408
Come on, man, you earned it.

785
00:51:48,279 --> 00:51:49,762
Buy yourself dinner.

786
00:51:49,845 --> 00:51:52,065
Give it away. But I'm
handing it to you.

787
00:51:57,636 --> 00:51:59,337
You could do this for
a living, you know?

788
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:01,296
I don't know about that.

789
00:52:01,379 --> 00:52:03,385
I really think we could busk
our way to fame and fortune.

790
00:52:07,776 --> 00:52:10,214
What made you stop
in front of me?

791
00:52:13,042 --> 00:52:14,305
Why did you start moving?

792
00:52:16,916 --> 00:52:19,575
He could say it was
because he was thinking

793
00:52:19,658 --> 00:52:23,405
about his old half-assed
band, The Retros,

794
00:52:23,488 --> 00:52:25,972
and how he liked to
dance across the stage

795
00:52:26,055 --> 00:52:27,753
during instrumental breaks.

796
00:52:29,407 --> 00:52:30,451
But that's not it.

797
00:52:34,586 --> 00:52:35,717
I don't know.

798
00:52:39,504 --> 00:52:40,900
Taylor, we gotta roll,

799
00:52:40,983 --> 00:52:42,119
or you're gonna end
up spending your take

800
00:52:42,202 --> 00:52:43,203
on my parking ticket.

801
00:52:44,987 --> 00:52:47,994
So, you guys don't
want a career change?

802
00:52:48,077 --> 00:52:49,909
Career change?
How... I mean...

803
00:52:49,992 --> 00:52:51,346
We'll make a name
for ourselves.

804
00:52:53,387 --> 00:52:54,910
You got to get in
here before you go.

805
00:52:55,998 --> 00:52:58,004
-Group hug.
-Oh, oh, okay.

806
00:52:58,087 --> 00:52:59,397
-Group hug.
-Okay.

807
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:00,920
Go.

808
00:53:01,003 --> 00:53:02,483
Come on.

809
00:53:08,881 --> 00:53:10,274
Buskers forever.

810
00:53:10,883 --> 00:53:12,367
Yeah. Buskers forever.

811
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:14,630
We gotta roll before
the meter maid shows up.

812
00:53:20,936 --> 00:53:22,199
I'm so sorry.

813
00:53:23,069 --> 00:53:24,248
That sucks.

814
00:53:24,331 --> 00:53:26,290
It does suck.

815
00:53:26,942 --> 00:53:28,466
I thought he was a nice guy.

816
00:53:28,901 --> 00:53:31,164
He was a pretty good lover,
and we had fun and all that.

817
00:53:32,687 --> 00:53:34,563
If I can find a
video of us dancing,

818
00:53:34,646 --> 00:53:37,305
which I'm gonna look
because I bet we go viral,

819
00:53:37,388 --> 00:53:39,524
I'm gonna send it
to him with a text,

820
00:53:39,607 --> 00:53:42,875
a text that says, "This
is what you're missing."

821
00:53:51,576 --> 00:53:52,838
You're gonna be fine.

822
00:53:55,057 --> 00:53:56,972
I don't know a lot,
but I know that much.

823
00:54:00,411 --> 00:54:02,417
You got a bright
sunbeam in front of you,

824
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:04,719
and you're gonna step
right into it, I can tell.

825
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:09,115
But yeah.

826
00:54:11,422 --> 00:54:13,685
It sucks. Not much else to say.

827
00:54:16,644 --> 00:54:17,954
Everything goes down the drain,

828
00:54:18,037 --> 00:54:19,651
and all we can say
is, "That sucks."

829
00:54:19,734 --> 00:54:21,475
Mm. Yeah.

830
00:54:23,042 --> 00:54:24,482
Maybe we're going
down the drain too.

831
00:54:26,959 --> 00:54:28,221
Maybe.

832
00:54:30,658 --> 00:54:31,658
I'm this way.

833
00:54:34,575 --> 00:54:36,316
Uh, I'm that way.

834
00:54:42,235 --> 00:54:43,410
Thank you for the dance.

835
00:55:39,031 --> 00:55:40,428
As he passes the place

836
00:55:40,511 --> 00:55:42,299
where Taylor set up her drums,

837
00:55:42,382 --> 00:55:44,471
those two questions recur.

838
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:49,389
Why did he stop to listen?

839
00:55:51,304 --> 00:55:54,046
And why did he start to dance?

840
00:55:57,049 --> 00:55:58,442
He doesn't know.

841
00:56:00,313 --> 00:56:02,881
And would answers make
a good thing better?

842
00:56:06,232 --> 00:56:09,278
Later, he'll lose
the ability to walk,

843
00:56:09,931 --> 00:56:12,329
never mind dancing
with little sister

844
00:56:12,412 --> 00:56:13,674
on the promenade.

845
00:56:14,762 --> 00:56:17,678
Later, he'll lose the
ability to chew food.

846
00:56:19,158 --> 00:56:21,639
Later, he'll forget
his wife's name.

847
00:56:23,205 --> 00:56:26,474
Later, he'll lose his
grip on the difference

848
00:56:26,557 --> 00:56:28,689
between waking and sleeping

849
00:56:29,168 --> 00:56:32,345
and enter a land
of pain so great

850
00:56:32,824 --> 00:56:35,392
he will wonder why
God made the world.

851
00:56:38,177 --> 00:56:41,010
What he will remember,
occasionally,

852
00:56:41,093 --> 00:56:45,014
is how he stopped and
dropped his briefcase

853
00:56:45,097 --> 00:56:48,579
and began to move his hips
to the beat of the drums.

854
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:51,237
And he will think

855
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,801
that is why God made the world.

856
00:56:55,847 --> 00:56:56,978
Just that.

857
00:57:21,089 --> 00:57:22,530
Chuck was looking forward

858
00:57:22,613 --> 00:57:24,266
to having a baby sister.

859
00:57:24,963 --> 00:57:26,882
Of course, he was
also looking forward

860
00:57:26,965 --> 00:57:28,884
to having parents,

861
00:57:28,967 --> 00:57:31,669
but none of that worked
out thanks to a patch

862
00:57:31,752 --> 00:57:35,321
of well-hidden ice
on an I-95 overpass.

863
00:57:38,585 --> 00:57:41,070
Chuck wasn't in the
car when it happened

864
00:57:41,153 --> 00:57:43,855
because his parents were
having a dinner date

865
00:57:43,938 --> 00:57:47,293
and he was being babysat
by his grandparents,

866
00:57:47,376 --> 00:57:50,641
who, at the time, he was still
calling Zaydee and Bubbie.

867
00:57:51,293 --> 00:57:52,777
He was seven years old.

868
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:54,558
Excellent job.

869
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:57,434
For a year and a
half, it was a house

870
00:57:57,517 --> 00:57:59,519
of unadulterated sadness.

871
00:58:01,086 --> 00:58:03,875
Albie and Sarah Krantz
had not only lost

872
00:58:03,958 --> 00:58:05,747
their son and daughter-in-law...

873
00:58:05,830 --> 00:58:07,662
Why're you not eating?

874
00:58:07,745 --> 00:58:09,403
...they had lost
the granddaughter

875
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:11,579
who would've been born
just three months later.

876
00:58:11,662 --> 00:58:13,359
What's going on?

877
00:58:13,794 --> 00:58:16,018
The name had already
been picked out...

878
00:58:16,101 --> 00:58:18,455
-Her name is Alyssa.
-...Alyssa.

879
00:58:18,538 --> 00:58:21,980
When Chuck said that
sounded to him like rain,

880
00:58:22,063 --> 00:58:24,849
his mother had laughed and
cried at the same time.

881
00:58:26,154 --> 00:58:27,504
He never forgot that.

882
00:58:29,854 --> 00:58:31,816
Albie processed his grief

883
00:58:31,899 --> 00:58:34,732
by turning to his two absolutes,

884
00:58:34,815 --> 00:58:37,252
numbers and alcohol.

885
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:40,651
Sarah, though, could find no joy

886
00:58:40,734 --> 00:58:42,562
in her usual pleasures.

887
00:58:43,128 --> 00:58:45,482
She loved the flavors of life,

888
00:58:45,565 --> 00:58:47,919
music, art, and food,

889
00:58:48,002 --> 00:58:50,444
but now, found the world quiet

890
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:53,225
and gray and flavorless.

891
00:58:55,444 --> 00:58:57,407
Some of the good
feelings came back

892
00:58:57,490 --> 00:58:59,801
into the house with time.

893
00:58:59,884 --> 00:59:01,455
There were a lot
of takeout meals

894
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:03,413
after the accident,

895
00:59:03,496 --> 00:59:05,371
but around the time
Chuck turned 10,

896
00:59:05,454 --> 00:59:07,848
his grandma started
cooking again.

897
00:59:08,762 --> 00:59:11,160
She liked rock-and-roll
while she was cooking.

898
00:59:13,201 --> 00:59:15,643
Music Chuck would've thought
much too young for her,

899
00:59:15,726 --> 00:59:17,815
but which she clearly enjoyed.

You could learn

You're a natural.

920
01:00:42,203 --> 01:00:43,731
Wh-Where did you learn?

921
01:00:43,814 --> 01:00:45,206
High school.

922
01:00:46,077 --> 01:00:47,677
What were you like
in high school?

923
01:00:49,341 --> 01:00:51,608
I was a kusit.

924
01:00:51,691 --> 01:00:53,562
But don't you tell your
Zaydee I said that.

925
01:00:54,128 --> 01:00:55,220
He's old school, that one.

926
01:00:58,567 --> 01:01:00,178
Chuck never told.

927
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,707
His grandparents' house became

928
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:05,709
every inch his home

929
01:01:05,792 --> 01:01:07,098
with one exception.

930
01:01:08,316 --> 01:01:10,057
The cupola on the roof.

931
01:01:13,234 --> 01:01:16,368
Chuck was forbidden
to go into the cupola.

932
01:01:16,934 --> 01:01:19,201
That was his grandfather's rule,

933
01:01:19,284 --> 01:01:23,292
and it was absolute, emphatic.

934
01:01:23,375 --> 01:01:26,687
Albie wasn't a stern
man in other matters.

935
01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:29,642
He was downright gentle
in most respects.

936
01:01:30,077 --> 01:01:31,862
But on this point, he was rigid.

937
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:37,349
Chuck asked about it, of course,

938
01:01:37,432 --> 01:01:38,607
and more than once.

939
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:40,788
What was up there?

940
01:01:40,871 --> 01:01:43,181
What could you see
from the high window?

941
01:01:43,264 --> 01:01:46,920
And the big question,
why was the room locked?

942
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:50,536
-Grandma said...
-Because the floor isn't safe

943
01:01:50,619 --> 01:01:52,408
and you might go
right through it.

944
01:01:52,491 --> 01:01:54,236
-Grandpa said...
-There's nothing up there

945
01:01:54,319 --> 01:01:55,933
because of that rotten floor.

946
01:01:56,016 --> 01:01:58,022
And the only thing you can
see through the windows

947
01:01:58,105 --> 01:01:59,894
is the shopping center.

948
01:01:59,977 --> 01:02:02,679
He said that until, one night,

949
01:02:02,762 --> 01:02:05,247
just before Chuck's
11th birthday,

950
01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:07,945
when he told at least
part of the truth.

951
01:02:08,028 --> 01:02:09,730
The cosmic calendar

952
01:02:09,813 --> 01:02:11,949
compresses the local
history of the universe

953
01:02:12,032 --> 01:02:14,034
into a single year.

954
01:02:14,382 --> 01:02:16,602
If the universe
began on January 1st,

955
01:02:17,124 --> 01:02:19,783
it was not until May that
the Milky Way formed.

956
01:02:19,866 --> 01:02:22,656
Drinking is not
good for secrets.

957
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:25,006
And after the death of his son,

958
01:02:25,089 --> 01:02:28,096
daughter-in-law, and
granddaughter-to-be,

959
01:02:28,179 --> 01:02:30,094
Alyssa, who sounds like rain,

960
01:02:30,877 --> 01:02:33,449
Albie Krantz drank a great deal.

961
01:02:33,532 --> 01:02:35,407
Everything humans
have ever done

962
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:37,366
occurred in that bright speck

963
01:02:37,449 --> 01:02:40,282
at the lower right of
the cosmic calendar.

964
01:02:40,365 --> 01:02:42,110
I'll bet you could see

965
01:02:42,193 --> 01:02:44,068
way past the Westford Mall

966
01:02:44,151 --> 01:02:45,283
from the cupola.

967
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:49,987
You gotta be able to see the
whole town from up there,

968
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:51,158
I bet.

969
01:02:52,377 --> 01:02:54,731
If you went up there,

970
01:02:54,814 --> 01:02:58,648
you might see a lot
more than you wanted.

971
01:02:58,731 --> 01:03:00,298
That's why it's locked, Chucko.

972
01:03:00,994 --> 01:03:04,041
Every month is one and a
quarter billion years long.

973
01:03:04,389 --> 01:03:07,091
Each day represents
40 million years.

974
01:03:07,174 --> 01:03:09,829
He wanted to ask
what Grandpa meant.

975
01:03:10,351 --> 01:03:14,098
But the adult part of
him, not there in person,

976
01:03:14,181 --> 01:03:17,362
no, not at 10, but something
that had begun to speak

977
01:03:17,445 --> 01:03:19,843
on rare occasions, told him

978
01:03:19,926 --> 01:03:22,106
-to be quiet.
-At this scale...

979
01:03:22,189 --> 01:03:24,844
Be quiet and wait.

980
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:29,070
But all of human history
would occupy an area

981
01:03:29,153 --> 01:03:30,328
the size of my hand.

982
01:03:31,242 --> 01:03:34,684
We're just beginning to trace
the long and tortuous path

983
01:03:34,767 --> 01:03:36,294
which began with the primeval...

984
01:03:36,377 --> 01:03:38,510
You know what style
of house this is?

985
01:03:39,511 --> 01:03:40,951
Victorian.

986
01:03:41,034 --> 01:03:42,079
That's right.

987
01:03:43,341 --> 01:03:45,216
And not pretend
Victorian either.

988
01:03:45,299 --> 01:03:48,259
It was built in 1885.

989
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:52,354
It's been remodeled half
a dozen times since.

990
01:03:52,437 --> 01:03:56,049
But that cupola was
there from the start.

991
01:03:57,355 --> 01:03:59,796
Been here since '71.

992
01:03:59,879 --> 01:04:02,494
And in all those years,
I haven't been up

993
01:04:02,577 --> 01:04:05,193
to that damn cupola
half a dozen times.

994
01:04:05,276 --> 01:04:07,104
'Cause the floor is rotted?

995
01:04:08,757 --> 01:04:10,672
'Cause it's full of ghosts.

996
01:04:12,239 --> 01:04:15,286
...around 10:30 p.m.
on December 31st.

997
01:04:15,939 --> 01:04:18,206
-Y-You remember Scrooge?
-Yeah.

998
01:04:18,289 --> 01:04:19,729
That Scrooge movie we watched?

999
01:04:19,812 --> 01:04:21,209
I remember.

1000
01:04:21,292 --> 01:04:23,642
Do you think of that
as a ghost story?

1001
01:04:24,948 --> 01:04:26,562
I-I-I guess so.

1002
01:04:26,645 --> 01:04:29,126
Heard someone say it
was a ghost story.

1003
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:33,826
Christmas Yet to Come.

1004
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:36,524
11:59:20,

1005
01:04:37,090 --> 01:04:39,618
evening, last day of the...

1006
01:04:39,701 --> 01:04:41,790
Jefferies boy was a month later.

1007
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,446
Henry Peterson,

1008
01:04:46,839 --> 01:04:48,101
that took longer.

1009
01:04:49,581 --> 01:04:53,284
Four... maybe five years on.

1010
01:04:53,367 --> 01:04:55,630
And by then...

1011
01:04:57,415 --> 01:05:00,070
I almost forgot
what I saw up there.

1012
01:05:02,507 --> 01:05:03,900
Almost.

1013
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:09,601
Said I'd never go back
up there after that.

1014
01:05:11,646 --> 01:05:15,172
And I wish I hadn't
because of Sarah.

1015
01:05:18,523 --> 01:05:21,352
Because of your Bubbie, Chucky.

1016
01:05:23,528 --> 01:05:25,225
Your sweet Bubbie.

1017
01:05:27,445 --> 01:05:28,794
And the bread.

1018
01:05:30,361 --> 01:05:32,624
Every person we've
ever heard of,

1019
01:05:33,799 --> 01:05:34,935
somewhere in there...

1020
01:05:35,018 --> 01:05:36,671
It's the waiting, Chucko.

1021
01:05:39,109 --> 01:05:40,810
That's the hard part.

1022
01:05:40,893 --> 01:05:43,030
Everything in
the history books

1023
01:05:43,113 --> 01:05:45,115
happened here

1024
01:05:45,985 --> 01:05:48,470
in the last 10 seconds
of the cosmic calendar.

1025
01:05:48,553 --> 01:05:50,037
Ooh!

1026
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:51,817
It's getting cold out there.

1027
01:05:52,252 --> 01:05:54,951
Vera says hi. She says
thanks for the soup.

1028
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:58,780
She laid the gossip
on me, laid it good.

1029
01:05:59,303 --> 01:06:00,917
Of course...

1030
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,310
That's why we have
a Vera, isn't it?

1031
01:06:02,393 --> 01:06:04,312
So, what's the latest?

1032
01:06:04,395 --> 01:06:06,096
Well, I don't know
if you've heard,

1033
01:06:06,179 --> 01:06:09,665
but Trish is saying Karen
and Matty are in therapy.

1034
01:06:09,748 --> 01:06:12,059
-Again.
-Who's Henry Peterson, Zaydee?

1035
01:06:12,142 --> 01:06:14,017
...the universe that made us

1036
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:17,364
or we can squander our
15 billion-year heritage.

1037
01:06:18,017 --> 01:06:19,893
And get some pancake mix.

1038
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:22,156
Yellow box, not the orange box.

1039
01:06:22,239 --> 01:06:24,114
-You got all that?
-I got it.

1040
01:06:24,197 --> 01:06:26,417
-Do you need me to write it down?
-I got it.

1041
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:28,249
Don't you think about driving.

1042
01:06:28,332 --> 01:06:30,033
The walk will sober you up.

1043
01:06:30,116 --> 01:06:31,513
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1044
01:06:49,744 --> 01:06:51,137
He'll be back with
some groceries.

1045
01:06:52,486 --> 01:06:54,101
Then, how about tonight,

1046
01:06:54,184 --> 01:06:56,838
we do some s'mores
in the fireplace?

1047
01:06:58,362 --> 01:07:00,233
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1048
01:07:02,366 --> 01:07:04,324
Was he blabbing to
you about his ghosts?

1049
01:07:06,065 --> 01:07:07,414
The ones that live
in the cupola?

1050
01:07:09,895 --> 01:07:10,983
Yeah.

1051
01:07:11,636 --> 01:07:13,029
Well, are there?

1052
01:07:15,074 --> 01:07:16,074
What do you think?

1053
01:07:17,424 --> 01:07:19,644
I wouldn't pay too much
attention to Zaydee.

1054
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:22,825
He's a good man. But, sometimes,

1055
01:07:22,908 --> 01:07:26,829
well, sometimes,
he drinks too much.

1056
01:07:26,912 --> 01:07:28,309
Then he rides his hobby horses.

1057
01:07:28,392 --> 01:07:29,658
I'm sure you know what
I'm talking about.

1058
01:07:29,741 --> 01:07:31,612
Who was the Jefferies boy?

1059
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,400
Well...

1060
01:07:38,358 --> 01:07:39,881
that was a very
sad thing, kiddo.

1061
01:07:41,753 --> 01:07:43,715
He lived on the next block over,

1062
01:07:43,798 --> 01:07:46,066
and he got hit by a car

1063
01:07:46,149 --> 01:07:48,020
when he chased a
ball into the street.

1064
01:07:49,326 --> 01:07:50,762
It happened a long time ago.

1065
01:07:53,678 --> 01:07:55,901
And if your grandpa says he
saw it before it happened,

1066
01:07:55,984 --> 01:07:57,203
he's mistaken.

1067
01:08:02,382 --> 01:08:04,080
He just drinks too much.

1068
01:08:15,613 --> 01:08:19,095
You know, I could take those
to Mrs. Stanley if you want.

1069
01:08:20,313 --> 01:08:22,232
Oh, that's very
thoughtful of you.

1070
01:08:22,315 --> 01:08:23,664
I bet Vera'd love that.

1071
01:08:24,883 --> 01:08:25,884
Mm.

1072
01:08:26,885 --> 01:08:28,412
Just wonderful.

1073
01:08:28,495 --> 01:08:30,066
Your, your grandmother
is an artist.

1074
01:08:30,149 --> 01:08:31,676
Thank you for
bringing them over.

1075
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:32,760
Was that your idea?

1076
01:08:33,326 --> 01:08:34,984
-Be honest.
-It was.

1077
01:08:35,067 --> 01:08:36,590
Well, can I make
you a cup of tea?

1078
01:08:37,156 --> 01:08:39,506
Um, I don't drink tea, but, um,

1079
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:41,726
I wouldn't mind a glass of milk.

1080
01:08:43,771 --> 01:08:45,077
Well, your
grandmother's a saint.

1081
01:08:46,165 --> 01:08:47,649
And what about your granddad?

1082
01:08:47,732 --> 01:08:49,390
Did he have that thing
on his back looked at?

1083
01:08:49,473 --> 01:08:52,088
Yeah, the, the doctor took
it off and had it tested.

1084
01:08:52,171 --> 01:08:53,371
Tell me everything.

1085
01:08:53,868 --> 01:08:55,435
It wasn't one of the bad ones.

1086
01:08:56,567 --> 01:08:57,829
Thank God for that.

1087
01:08:58,308 --> 01:08:59,308
Yeah.

1088
01:09:00,875 --> 01:09:03,012
He, um, he was
talking to Grandma

1089
01:09:03,095 --> 01:09:05,750
about someone named
Henry Peterson.

1090
01:09:07,621 --> 01:09:08,844
So awful.

1091
01:09:08,927 --> 01:09:10,541
You know, Henry
was a bookkeeper,

1092
01:09:10,624 --> 01:09:11,930
just like your granddad.

1093
01:09:12,365 --> 01:09:14,110
He did a lot of the
other businesses in town.

1094
01:09:14,193 --> 01:09:15,546
The ones that your
Zaydee didn't do...

1095
01:09:15,629 --> 01:09:17,065
How did it happen?

1096
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:21,683
I don't think you want
to hear about that stuff.

1097
01:09:21,766 --> 01:09:26,035
Um, w-w-well, Granddad
said it was, uh, peaceful.

1098
01:09:26,118 --> 01:09:27,598
Peaceful?

1099
01:09:28,294 --> 01:09:30,514
He killed himself. Hung himself.

1100
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:32,781
His wife, you see, she ran off

1101
01:09:32,864 --> 01:09:34,826
with this younger man,
barely old enough to vote.

1102
01:09:34,909 --> 01:09:37,129
And she was in her 40s.
What do you think of that?

1103
01:09:38,478 --> 01:09:39,962
-Wow.
-Damn right, wow.

1104
01:09:40,045 --> 01:09:42,134
And then, I heard that...

1105
01:09:48,009 --> 01:09:49,446
What's happening at school?

1106
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:53,410
Who's smooching who?

1107
01:09:53,493 --> 01:09:56,500
"Talk honestly, for
no one else hears you

1108
01:09:56,583 --> 01:09:58,720
and I stay only
a minute longer."

1109
01:09:58,803 --> 01:10:01,066
"Do I contradict myself?

1110
01:10:01,806 --> 01:10:02,981
"Very well then,"

1111
01:10:03,808 --> 01:10:05,070
"I contradict myself,"

1112
01:10:06,593 --> 01:10:07,681
"I am large.

1113
01:10:08,987 --> 01:10:10,597
I contain multitudes."

1114
01:10:11,032 --> 01:10:13,256
On the last day
of sixth grade,

1115
01:10:13,339 --> 01:10:14,866
Miss Richards,

1116
01:10:14,949 --> 01:10:16,999
a sweet, hippie-dippyish
young woman

1117
01:10:17,082 --> 01:10:19,480
who had no command of discipline

1118
01:10:19,563 --> 01:10:21,699
and would probably not last long

1119
01:10:21,782 --> 01:10:24,354
in the public education system,

1120
01:10:24,437 --> 01:10:27,009
tried to recite
for Chuck's class

1121
01:10:27,092 --> 01:10:31,357
some verse of Walt
Whitman's "Song of Myself."

1122
01:10:32,793 --> 01:10:35,318
"Failing to fetch me at
first keep encouraged.

1123
01:10:36,275 --> 01:10:38,451
Missing me one place,
search another."

1124
01:10:52,335 --> 01:10:53,988
That went well, don't you think?

1125
01:10:55,163 --> 01:10:57,601
Yeah, I'm, I'm sorry about that.

1126
01:10:59,385 --> 01:11:03,433
What does he mean when
he says, "I am large,

1127
01:11:03,955 --> 01:11:06,174
I contain multitudes"?

1128
01:11:09,395 --> 01:11:10,701
What do you think he means?

1129
01:11:11,745 --> 01:11:13,925
All the people he knows.

1130
01:11:14,008 --> 01:11:15,096
Yes.

1131
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:17,316
But maybe he means even more.

1132
01:11:18,796 --> 01:11:20,276
Here. Come here.

1133
01:11:24,323 --> 01:11:26,677
What's in there?
Between my hands?

1134
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:28,505
My brain.

1135
01:11:28,588 --> 01:11:30,851
No, um, that's not
exactly what I mean.

1136
01:11:31,809 --> 01:11:32,940
What's in there?

1137
01:11:33,506 --> 01:11:35,334
Right between my
hands right now.

1138
01:11:37,031 --> 01:11:38,119
I don't know.

1139
01:11:38,685 --> 01:11:39,947
All the people you know?

1140
01:11:41,122 --> 01:11:42,123
I guess.

1141
01:11:42,820 --> 01:11:44,212
Just the people you know?

1142
01:11:46,824 --> 01:11:47,999
Everything you see.

1143
01:11:48,782 --> 01:11:50,175
Everything you know.

1144
01:11:51,481 --> 01:11:53,443
The world, Chuck.

1145
01:11:53,526 --> 01:11:56,229
Planes in the sky. Manhole
covers in the street.

1146
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:59,362
Every year that you live,
that world inside your head

1147
01:11:59,445 --> 01:12:03,319
will get bigger and brighter
and more detailed and complex.

1148
01:12:04,145 --> 01:12:06,935
You will build cities and
countries and continents,

1149
01:12:07,018 --> 01:12:10,765
and you will fill them
with people and faces,

1150
01:12:10,848 --> 01:12:12,201
real and imagined.

1151
01:12:12,284 --> 01:12:13,851
Do you understand?

1152
01:12:15,374 --> 01:12:16,727
Don't stop there.

1153
01:12:16,810 --> 01:12:18,860
You fill the whole thing

1154
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:20,640
with everyone you ever meet,

1155
01:12:21,206 --> 01:12:22,555
everyone you ever know,

1156
01:12:23,121 --> 01:12:25,471
everyone you ever just imagine.

1157
01:12:26,603 --> 01:12:28,256
It'll be a universe.

1158
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:33,305
A whole universe right
between my hands.

1159
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:37,875
You contain multitudes.

1160
01:12:41,182 --> 01:12:42,227
So...

1161
01:12:44,011 --> 01:12:46,884
what happens to that
universe if someone...

1162
01:12:48,276 --> 01:12:49,756
I don't know,

1163
01:12:50,453 --> 01:12:53,760
hits a patch of ice and
goes off an overpass or...

1164
01:12:56,937 --> 01:12:58,722
Don't worry too much
about those things.

1165
01:12:59,810 --> 01:13:03,422
Just remember that you
contain multitudes, Chuck.

1166
01:13:05,337 --> 01:13:06,599
Isn't that wonderful?

1167
01:13:09,167 --> 01:13:11,391
Now, go on. You were
such a good boy.

1168
01:13:11,474 --> 01:13:13,345
I've really enjoyed
having you in class.

1169
01:13:35,149 --> 01:13:37,068
Chuck did enjoy his summer

1170
01:13:37,151 --> 01:13:38,718
until August,

1171
01:13:39,458 --> 01:13:40,633
when Bubbie died.

1172
01:13:45,464 --> 01:13:47,209
It happened at the grocery store

1173
01:13:47,292 --> 01:13:49,385
down the street, in public,

1174
01:13:49,468 --> 01:13:52,083
which was a little undignified,

1175
01:13:52,166 --> 01:13:54,172
but at least it was
the kind of death

1176
01:13:54,255 --> 01:13:55,783
where people can safely say...

1177
01:13:55,866 --> 01:13:57,345
Thank God she didn't suffer.

1178
01:13:59,086 --> 01:14:00,353
The other standby...

1179
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:02,137
She had a long, full life.

1180
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:04,222
...was more of a gray area.

1181
01:14:05,136 --> 01:14:08,182
Sarah Krantz had yet
to reach her mid-60s.

1182
01:14:12,056 --> 01:14:14,802
Once more, the house
on Pilchard Street

1183
01:14:14,885 --> 01:14:17,670
was one of
unadulterated sadness.

1184
01:14:19,106 --> 01:14:22,723
Albie wore his mourning
band, and lost weight,

1185
01:14:22,806 --> 01:14:25,160
and stopped telling his jokes

1186
01:14:25,243 --> 01:14:28,768
and began to look older
than his 70 years.

1187
01:14:36,341 --> 01:14:37,690
-That's it?
-Yeah.

1188
01:14:39,387 --> 01:14:40,867
Buck 75.

1189
01:14:43,391 --> 01:14:46,612
Um, that lady who was
in here a few weeks ago,

1190
01:14:47,570 --> 01:14:49,441
the one who died.

1191
01:14:50,355 --> 01:14:53,010
Where was she when it happened?

1192
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:55,316
That's a little creepy, kid.

1193
01:14:57,362 --> 01:14:58,711
She was my grandma.

1194
01:15:01,018 --> 01:15:02,937
She was getting
a loaf of bread.

1195
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:04,765
Pulled down almost everything

1196
01:15:04,848 --> 01:15:06,589
on the shelf when she collapsed.

1197
01:15:07,415 --> 01:15:11,071
I'm sorry if that's
too much information.

1198
01:15:12,769 --> 01:15:13,987
Nah.

1199
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:16,686
I already knew that.

1200
01:16:12,437 --> 01:16:13,873
-No!
-What?!

1201
01:16:15,179 --> 01:16:18,617
-Get away from there! You get away from there.
-What? Hey, hey!

1202
01:16:41,988 --> 01:16:43,120
Give me that.

1203
01:16:45,383 --> 01:16:47,254
Give it to me. Give it to me.

1204
01:16:47,951 --> 01:16:49,043
Give me it.

1205
01:16:53,565 --> 01:16:54,831
Oh.

1206
01:16:54,914 --> 01:16:56,873
Oh, I'm sorry.

1207
01:16:57,438 --> 01:16:58,966
I'm sorry.

1208
01:16:59,049 --> 01:17:00,663
Are you okay?

1209
01:17:00,746 --> 01:17:02,356
What did you see?

1210
01:17:04,576 --> 01:17:06,582
What did you see?

1211
01:17:06,665 --> 01:17:09,581
I'm sorry. It's just, you can't.

1212
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:12,671
You can't do that, Chucky.

1213
01:17:13,585 --> 01:17:15,199
You just can't.

1214
01:17:15,282 --> 01:17:16,723
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1215
01:17:16,806 --> 01:17:20,727
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry.

1216
01:17:20,810 --> 01:17:22,946
I'm sorry.

1217
01:17:45,269 --> 01:17:46,509
Come on, little brother.

1218
01:17:47,314 --> 01:17:48,751
Let's dance.

1219
01:18:04,897 --> 01:18:07,600
Hello, twirlers,
and hello, spinners.

1220
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:10,254
What do you know?
Three boys this year.

1221
01:18:10,337 --> 01:18:11,691
It's a new record.

1222
01:18:11,774 --> 01:18:13,388
You gentlemen might
find yourselves

1223
01:18:13,471 --> 01:18:15,085
being teased for your new hobby.

1224
01:18:15,168 --> 01:18:17,610
I assure you, you are
the smartest young men

1225
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:18,959
in the whole school.

1226
01:18:19,042 --> 01:18:20,347
You'll soon see what I mean.

1227
01:18:21,087 --> 01:18:24,051
For those who don't know
me, I am Miss Rohrbacher.

1228
01:18:24,134 --> 01:18:26,140
And when I'm not teaching
the girls phys-ed,

1229
01:18:26,223 --> 01:18:28,708
I am what a few
students have called,

1230
01:18:28,791 --> 01:18:30,488
"The Dance Monster."

1231
01:18:31,489 --> 01:18:33,234
Nothing? Alright.

1232
01:18:33,317 --> 01:18:34,757
You have chosen what might be

1233
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:37,107
the best club this
school has ever had.

1234
01:18:37,190 --> 01:18:38,848
'Cause if we didn't
have girls volleyball,

1235
01:18:38,931 --> 01:18:40,197
we wouldn't have nothing.

1236
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:42,286
No, no, no.

1237
01:18:42,369 --> 01:18:45,938
Back, Mr. Mulford,
you are mine now.

1238
01:18:47,766 --> 01:18:49,681
Waltz.

1239
01:18:51,378 --> 01:18:52,728
Chuck knew it.

1240
01:18:56,470 --> 01:18:57,689
Cha-cha.

1241
01:18:59,517 --> 01:19:00,605
Chuck knew it.

1242
01:19:03,042 --> 01:19:04,744
Swing.

1243
01:19:04,827 --> 01:19:06,528
Triple step. Rock step.

1244
01:19:06,611 --> 01:19:08,225
-Triple step. Rock step.
-Chuck knew it.

1245
01:19:08,308 --> 01:19:11,141
Triple step. Rock step.

1246
01:19:11,224 --> 01:19:12,965
Samba.

1247
01:19:15,968 --> 01:19:17,060
Don't know that one.

1248
01:19:17,143 --> 01:19:18,583
He was, by far,

1249
01:19:18,666 --> 01:19:20,324
the best dancer in
the little club.

1250
01:19:20,407 --> 01:19:22,631
So, Miss Rohrbacher
mostly put him

1251
01:19:22,714 --> 01:19:24,498
with the girls who were clumsy.

1252
01:19:24,977 --> 01:19:27,680
He understood she did
it to make them better,

1253
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:29,460
and he was a good
sport about it.

1254
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:32,685
Near the end of their
two hours, however,

1255
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:35,426
The Dance Monster
would show mercy

1256
01:19:35,509 --> 01:19:38,038
and pair him with Cat McCoy,

1257
01:19:38,121 --> 01:19:39,866
who was an eighth grader

1258
01:19:39,949 --> 01:19:42,778
and the best dancer
of the girls.

1259
01:19:43,909 --> 01:19:46,172
Chuck didn't expect romance.

1260
01:19:46,564 --> 01:19:48,483
Cat was not only gorgeous,

1261
01:19:48,566 --> 01:19:51,090
she was a full foot
taller than he was.

1262
01:19:51,656 --> 01:19:54,184
But he loved to dance with her,

1263
01:19:54,267 --> 01:19:56,095
and the feeling was mutual.

1264
01:19:56,617 --> 01:19:58,968
...three. Out,
two, three. Switch.

1265
01:19:59,446 --> 01:20:00,534
And stop.

1266
01:20:01,274 --> 01:20:03,803
In, two, three. Out, two, three.

1267
01:20:03,886 --> 01:20:06,109
Turn. Now box.

1268
01:20:06,192 --> 01:20:11,854
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

1269
01:20:11,937 --> 01:20:14,204
I don't know what that is.

1270
01:20:14,287 --> 01:20:15,815
Oh, my God.

1271
01:20:15,898 --> 01:20:18,643

You figured that
out by yourself?

1298
01:21:36,282 --> 01:21:38,201
Well, I just kept
rewinding and rewinding

1299
01:21:38,284 --> 01:21:39,895
til I figured it out.

1300
01:21:42,593 --> 01:21:43,833
We should do that at the Fling.

1301
01:21:45,944 --> 01:21:50,170
Uh, not as a date or anything.

1302

Yeah.

we couldn't show them

1307
01:22:02,395 --> 01:22:04,354

I-I don't know.

1309
01:22:07,009 --> 01:22:08,488
I'm a lot shorter.

1310
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:11,404
I think people will laugh.

1311
01:22:27,072 --> 01:22:29,383
-That totally works.
-It totally does.

1312
01:22:29,466 --> 01:22:31,689
-Are you sure?
-Oh, yeah, I'm sure.

1313
01:22:31,772 --> 01:22:33,470
Well, they feel great!

1314
01:22:34,297 --> 01:22:36,386
Uh, just a little big.

1315
01:22:39,650 --> 01:22:41,177
That should be enough.

1316
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:42,570
-Little more.
-Maybe one more.

1317
01:22:42,653 --> 01:22:43,959
How's that?

1318
01:22:46,483 --> 01:22:49,051
Floor feels like ice.

1319
01:22:49,703 --> 01:22:51,013
You put scratches on that floor,

1320
01:22:51,096 --> 01:22:53,015
-the janitor is gonna beat y...
-Timmy.

1321
01:22:53,098 --> 01:22:54,799
There won't be no scratches.

1322
01:22:54,882 --> 01:22:56,667
He's too light on his
feet to leave any.

1323
01:22:58,190 --> 01:23:00,279
Almost perfect.

1324
01:23:04,805 --> 01:23:06,372
Take another run at these two.

1325
01:23:08,635 --> 01:23:10,289
You don't need to sigh.

1326
01:23:10,855 --> 01:23:12,165
You're good at this, you know?

1327
01:23:12,248 --> 01:23:13,818
You're really good at it.

1328
01:23:13,901 --> 01:23:15,773
Yeah, but it's boring.

1329
01:23:16,469 --> 01:23:18,998
Boring? What, you mean math?

1330
01:23:19,081 --> 01:23:20,347
Yeah.

1331
01:23:20,430 --> 01:23:22,566
I wonder if maybe next semester

1332
01:23:22,649 --> 01:23:25,004
you might want to try
Math League after school.

1333
01:23:25,087 --> 01:23:27,267
I did it all high
school, in fact,

1334
01:23:27,350 --> 01:23:28,833
and it was so great.

1335
01:23:28,916 --> 01:23:30,744
I'm doing Twirlers and Spinners.

1336
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:33,312
Yeah.

1337
01:23:35,184 --> 01:23:37,664
Hey, hey, put that down
for a second, will you?

1338
01:23:38,665 --> 01:23:40,189
Just a little about math.

1339
01:23:41,059 --> 01:23:43,022
Because people
start out thinking

1340
01:23:43,105 --> 01:23:44,327
it might be boring,

1341
01:23:44,410 --> 01:23:46,238
and that's their first mistake.

1342
01:23:46,978 --> 01:23:50,638
It's used in every
career, in every job,

1343
01:23:50,721 --> 01:23:53,206
in every facet of
life on this planet.

1344
01:23:53,289 --> 01:23:55,856
That's a fact. Hell, the planet.

1345
01:23:56,509 --> 01:23:58,859
How do you think we figure
out how long a day is?

1346
01:23:59,817 --> 01:24:01,862
Everybody knows
how long a day is.

1347
01:24:02,341 --> 01:24:04,691
-How long?
-Twenty-four hours.

1348
01:24:05,170 --> 01:24:07,738
People say it's 24
hours, but they're wrong.

1349
01:24:08,434 --> 01:24:12,268
There are 23 hours
and 56 minutes

1350
01:24:12,351 --> 01:24:13,835
in a stellar day.

1351
01:24:13,918 --> 01:24:16,703
Plus a few odd seconds.
Math proves it.

1352
01:24:17,530 --> 01:24:19,884
How do we know how
old the Earth is?

1353
01:24:19,967 --> 01:24:23,018
How old the universe is, how
long people have been here?

1354
01:24:23,101 --> 01:24:25,412
Or how to build a
bridge or a skyscraper

1355
01:24:25,495 --> 01:24:27,497
or how far apart the stars are?

1356
01:24:28,019 --> 01:24:29,764
How did we land on the moon?

1357
01:24:29,847 --> 01:24:31,592
The stars themselves.

1358
01:24:31,675 --> 01:24:33,768
Why they burn, why
atoms split and fuse,

1359
01:24:33,851 --> 01:24:35,896
and all the rest is just math.

1360
01:24:37,855 --> 01:24:39,900
Hey, stars are just math.

1361
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:42,472
When you look at the night sky,

1362
01:24:42,555 --> 01:24:44,561
you're seeing the
greatest equation

1363
01:24:44,644 --> 01:24:46,255
in the universe.

1364
01:24:46,646 --> 01:24:49,392
Heck, your dancing,
that's math too.

1365
01:24:49,475 --> 01:24:52,395
I mean, what's the
language of dance?

1366
01:24:52,478 --> 01:24:55,529
How do you learn your steps?
It's even in the name.

1367
01:24:55,612 --> 01:24:57,922
I mean, they call
it "the count."

1368
01:24:58,005 --> 01:24:59,620
One and two and three and four.

1369
01:24:59,703 --> 01:25:02,449
What's a waltz? One, two,
three, one, two, three.

1370
01:25:02,532 --> 01:25:04,751
Just numbers, just math.

1371
01:25:05,709 --> 01:25:06,884
And more than that,

1372
01:25:08,015 --> 01:25:09,495
there's an art to it.

1373
01:25:10,627 --> 01:25:13,025
What I do, all these files here,

1374
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:14,500
all these folders,

1375
01:25:15,588 --> 01:25:18,204
these are all people's lives.

1376
01:25:18,287 --> 01:25:20,115
Every choice they made.

1377
01:25:20,985 --> 01:25:22,943
Last year, last 10 years.

1378
01:25:23,509 --> 01:25:25,472
Everything that's
important to them.

1379
01:25:25,555 --> 01:25:28,649
Every weakness they have,
every vice, every dream,

1380
01:25:28,732 --> 01:25:31,996
it's all here in numbers.

1381
01:25:32,692 --> 01:25:35,090
Some schmuck comes in,
takes those numbers,

1382
01:25:35,173 --> 01:25:38,437
does the math without artistry,
someone loses their house.

1383
01:25:39,177 --> 01:25:42,354
I take those numbers,
do a little art,

1384
01:25:43,181 --> 01:25:44,574
I save someone's life.

1385
01:25:45,618 --> 01:25:46,663
That's what I do.

1386
01:25:47,272 --> 01:25:49,492
That's what accounting is.

1387
01:25:50,362 --> 01:25:52,499
Well, maybe they
should teach that,

1388
01:25:52,582 --> 01:25:54,414
the cool stuff,

1389
01:25:54,497 --> 01:25:57,500
and not just all
the boring stuff.

1390
01:25:58,283 --> 01:25:59,283
Hmm.

1391
01:26:06,770 --> 01:26:09,646
Math is something else too.

1392
01:26:09,729 --> 01:26:12,345
Some math, math that's
called statistics

1393
01:26:12,428 --> 01:26:13,733
or probability,

1394
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,954
it can tell you stuff
about your future.

1395
01:26:18,477 --> 01:26:20,218
It could tell you, for example,

1396
01:26:21,611 --> 01:26:23,356
you're more likely to be drafted

1397
01:26:23,439 --> 01:26:25,401
by a major league sports team

1398
01:26:25,484 --> 01:26:28,052
than to make a real
living as a dancer.

1399
01:26:32,056 --> 01:26:35,146
The world loves
dancers, it truly does.

1400
01:26:35,799 --> 01:26:40,068
But it needs accountants,
so there's much more demand,

1401
01:26:40,151 --> 01:26:42,719
so there's much
more opportunity.

1402
01:26:44,024 --> 01:26:47,114
I know that might hurt,
but it's the truth.

1403
01:26:48,072 --> 01:26:52,076
Math is truth. It
won't lie to you.

1404
01:26:53,077 --> 01:26:55,736
It doesn't factor
in your preferences.

1405
01:26:55,819 --> 01:26:57,690
It's pure that way.

1406
01:26:58,996 --> 01:27:01,346
Math can do a lot of things.

1407
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,262
Math can be art.

1408
01:27:06,395 --> 01:27:08,135
But it can't lie.

1409
01:27:08,745 --> 01:27:09,745
So...

1410
01:27:11,443 --> 01:27:13,145
take another run at those two

1411
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:14,403
because, Chucko,

1412
01:27:15,578 --> 01:27:17,406
you are good.

1413
01:27:18,537 --> 01:27:21,758

None of that out there
really means anything.

1445
01:29:27,666 --> 01:29:30,282
It's all just, just a scrimmage.

1446
01:29:30,365 --> 01:29:31,935

1450
01:29:40,723 --> 01:29:42,119
Chuck, come on.

1451
01:29:42,202 --> 01:29:43,599
We're gonna blow the roof off.

01:29:43,682 --> 01:29:44,857

1453
01:29:45,902 --> 01:29:47,382
It really hurts.

1454
01:30:01,918 --> 01:30:05,225
You know, I've been
dancing since I was eight,

1455
01:30:05,661 --> 01:30:07,053
and I teach PE,

1456
01:30:07,706 --> 01:30:10,060
and I've seen when
my kids get hurt.

1457
01:30:10,143 --> 01:30:11,845
I see how their walk changes.

1458
01:30:11,928 --> 01:30:14,326
I see how their posture changes.

1459
01:30:14,409 --> 01:30:16,411

saying, but you look...

1513
01:34:22,700 --> 01:34:25,272
but they were smart enough
to know when to quit.

01:34:33,929 --> 01:34:35,325
Thank you, guys.

1515
01:34:35,408 --> 01:34:36,979
Six months before he died

1516
01:34:37,062 --> 01:34:40,635
of a brain tumor at
the unfair age of 39,

1517
01:34:40,718 --> 01:34:43,982
and while his mind was
still working, mostly,

1518
01:34:44,461 --> 01:34:47,468
Chuck told his wife the
truth about the scar

1519
01:34:47,551 --> 01:34:48,900
on the back of his hand.

1520
01:34:50,772 --> 01:34:52,560
When they'd first
started dating,

1521
01:34:52,643 --> 01:34:54,475
he told her he'd
gotten it from a boy

1522
01:34:54,558 --> 01:34:56,477
named Doug Wentworth,

1523
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:59,349
who was pissed about him
dancing with his girlfriend

1524
01:34:59,432 --> 01:35:01,090
at a middle school formal

1525
01:35:01,173 --> 01:35:03,223
and pushed him into
a chain link fence

1526
01:35:03,306 --> 01:35:04,441
outside the gym.

1527
01:35:04,524 --> 01:35:05,917
I lied about that, though.

1528
01:35:09,051 --> 01:35:10,230
Oh, my.

1529
01:35:10,313 --> 01:35:12,536
A man of secrets,

1530
01:35:12,619 --> 01:35:13,838
even still.

1531
01:35:16,058 --> 01:35:17,803
What happened, love?

1532
01:35:17,886 --> 01:35:19,931
When our fabulous
dance was over, I...

1533
01:35:20,584 --> 01:35:22,804
I was sweaty and I was so hot.

1534
01:35:23,761 --> 01:35:25,811
I-I felt like my cheeks
were gonna catch fire.

1535
01:35:25,894 --> 01:35:27,073
You were great.

1536
01:35:27,156 --> 01:35:28,592
-Thank you.
-What a star.

1537
01:35:29,898 --> 01:35:31,120
All I wanted in that moment

1538
01:35:31,203 --> 01:35:33,427
was just darkness,

1539
01:35:33,510 --> 01:35:34,816
cool air,

1540
01:35:35,860 --> 01:35:37,253
and to be by myself.

1541
01:35:41,997 --> 01:35:43,868
There were millions
of stars that night.

1542
01:35:45,740 --> 01:35:47,002
Millions of them.

1543
01:35:47,611 --> 01:35:49,308
And millions more behind them.

1544
01:35:50,353 --> 01:35:54,096
And sure, m-may... Yeah,
maybe they were just math.

1545
01:35:55,314 --> 01:35:57,756
But they also danced.

1546
01:35:57,839 --> 01:36:00,755
I know 'cause I saw one of them.

1547
01:36:02,887 --> 01:36:06,460
And I remember thinking,
the universe is large

1548
01:36:06,543 --> 01:36:08,897
and, and it contains multitudes,

1549
01:36:08,980 --> 01:36:12,418
but it-it also contains me.

1550
01:36:13,593 --> 01:36:14,943
And in this moment...

1551
01:36:16,683 --> 01:36:18,250
I am wonderful.

1552
01:36:19,686 --> 01:36:22,128
And I have a right
to be wonderful.

1553
01:36:22,211 --> 01:36:24,126
Oh!

1554
01:36:27,782 --> 01:36:29,392
Why lie about that, silly?

1555
01:36:31,176 --> 01:36:33,265
You're a strange
wonder, my dear.

1556
01:36:35,093 --> 01:36:37,230
He doesn't offer more

1557
01:36:37,313 --> 01:36:40,664
because the scar was
important for another reason.

1558
01:36:42,013 --> 01:36:44,581
It was part of a story
he couldn't tell,

1559
01:36:45,190 --> 01:36:47,849
even though there was
now an apartment building

1560
01:36:47,932 --> 01:36:50,112
on the site of the
Victorian house

1561
01:36:50,195 --> 01:36:52,458
where he had done most
of his growing up.

1562
01:36:53,764 --> 01:36:56,336
The haunted Victorian house.

1563
01:36:56,419 --> 01:36:57,420
Mm.

1564
01:36:57,986 --> 01:36:58,986
No reason.

1565
01:37:00,815 --> 01:37:02,338
Funny thinking, I guess.

1566
01:37:03,121 --> 01:37:05,084
The scar meant more,

1567
01:37:05,167 --> 01:37:07,169
so he had made it more.

1568
01:37:07,647 --> 01:37:11,477
He just couldn't make it as
much more as it really was.

1569
01:37:12,087 --> 01:37:14,223
That made little sense.

1570
01:37:14,306 --> 01:37:18,049
But as the glioblastoma
continued its blitzkrieg,

1571
01:37:18,702 --> 01:37:20,969
it was the best his
disintegrating mind

1572
01:37:21,052 --> 01:37:22,101
could manage.

1573
01:37:54,912 --> 01:37:56,570
Chuck's grandpa,

1574
01:37:56,653 --> 01:37:57,784
his Zaydee,

1575
01:37:58,655 --> 01:38:00,313
died of a heart attack

1576
01:38:00,396 --> 01:38:04,404
five years after the
Fall Fling dance.

1577
01:38:04,487 --> 01:38:06,972
Chuck was a junior
in high school

1578
01:38:07,055 --> 01:38:10,105
singing in a band and
dancing like Jagger

1579
01:38:10,188 --> 01:38:12,190
during the instrumental breaks.

1580
01:38:12,843 --> 01:38:15,003
He made all the
arrangements himself.

1581
01:38:16,238 --> 01:38:18,157
Came in a few weeks ago

1582
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:20,507
just to make sure everything
was to the letter,

1583
01:38:20,590 --> 01:38:22,635
which I thought was strange.

1584
01:38:23,419 --> 01:38:25,164
Not many people
bother to do that.

1585
01:38:25,247 --> 01:38:26,774
Most people,

1586
01:38:26,857 --> 01:38:29,338
they come here once
to set it all up.

1587
01:38:30,165 --> 01:38:31,862
They aren't anxious
to come back again.

1588
01:38:33,429 --> 01:38:36,479
Next time I see 'em, they're
in their Sunday best,

1589
01:38:36,562 --> 01:38:37,737
if you get me.

1590
01:38:39,957 --> 01:38:43,004
He was a great man
and a good friend.

1591
01:38:44,570 --> 01:38:47,229
He's been doing our
books for 23 years

1592
01:38:47,312 --> 01:38:49,579
and saved our skin
more than once

1593
01:38:49,662 --> 01:38:50,925
when the tax man was coming.

1594
01:38:53,753 --> 01:38:56,238
So, do I owe you any money?

1595
01:38:56,321 --> 01:38:57,892
Not a penny.

1596
01:38:57,975 --> 01:39:01,113
He took care of that
too. Settled his tab

1597
01:39:01,196 --> 01:39:02,632
that same visit.

1598
01:39:03,720 --> 01:39:04,721
You know...

1599
01:39:05,983 --> 01:39:07,332
the strangest thing.

1600
01:39:08,072 --> 01:39:10,857
And this will sound
strange, so bear with me.

1601
01:39:11,423 --> 01:39:13,991
See, I, uh,

1602
01:39:14,513 --> 01:39:16,780
dreamed of being a
television weatherman

1603
01:39:16,863 --> 01:39:18,043
in my salad days

1604
01:39:18,126 --> 01:39:19,605
with maybe one of the networks.

1605
01:39:20,867 --> 01:39:22,130
Wasn't in the cards for me.

1606
01:39:23,305 --> 01:39:26,917
But I did spend
a summer at WKNB.

1607
01:39:28,136 --> 01:39:30,751
Well, there was a guy

1608
01:39:30,834 --> 01:39:32,884
at KNB who they said

1609
01:39:32,967 --> 01:39:34,886
could feel a storm coming

1610
01:39:34,969 --> 01:39:36,709
two solid weeks away

1611
01:39:37,232 --> 01:39:38,759
without the radar.

1612
01:39:38,842 --> 01:39:40,543
Had a sixth sense.

1613
01:39:40,626 --> 01:39:42,411
Damnedest thing I ever saw.

1614
01:39:43,064 --> 01:39:45,287
Uh, used to make this face,

1615
01:39:45,370 --> 01:39:48,769
this face when people talked
about their travel plans,

1616
01:39:48,852 --> 01:39:50,858
if he knew something
they didn't.

1617
01:39:50,941 --> 01:39:54,035
Not... not a smile, per se.

1618
01:39:54,118 --> 01:39:55,863
No joy in it.

1619
01:39:55,946 --> 01:39:59,080
Just a... knowing.

1620
01:40:00,385 --> 01:40:02,126
"Weatherman Stare," I called it.

1621
01:40:03,301 --> 01:40:05,917
And I didn't have it, not me.

1622
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,350
So, I'm here, not there.

1623
01:40:11,222 --> 01:40:14,055
Your granddad had that same face

1624
01:40:14,138 --> 01:40:15,661
when he was in here.

1625
01:40:16,619 --> 01:40:20,057
Like... he knew
it was gonna rain.

1626
01:40:20,753 --> 01:40:23,147
And I was just a guy
selling him an umbrella.

1627
01:40:25,541 --> 01:40:26,846
Weatherman Stare.

1628
01:40:27,847 --> 01:40:29,327
I'm sure of it.

1629
01:40:30,850 --> 01:40:31,938
The strangest thing.

1630
01:40:34,202 --> 01:40:36,382
Albie left him everything.

1631
01:40:36,465 --> 01:40:39,685
More than enough to pay
for his college education.

1632
01:40:40,164 --> 01:40:42,823
And later on, the
sale of the Victorian

1633
01:40:42,906 --> 01:40:45,913
paid for the house he
and Ginny moved into

1634
01:40:45,996 --> 01:40:48,390
after their honeymoon
in the Catskills.

1635
01:40:50,479 --> 01:40:53,355
He flatly refused
to move to Omaha

1636
01:40:53,438 --> 01:40:55,658
to live with his
mother's parents.

1637
01:40:56,267 --> 01:40:58,099
-Look, I love you guys...
-He said.

1638
01:40:58,182 --> 01:41:01,494
...but this is where I grew up
and want to stay till college.

1639
01:41:01,577 --> 01:41:03,187
I'm 17. I'm not a baby.

1640
01:41:03,709 --> 01:41:06,020
So, they, both long retired,

1641
01:41:06,103 --> 01:41:07,674
came to him

1642
01:41:07,757 --> 01:41:09,589
and stayed in the Victorian

1643
01:41:09,672 --> 01:41:12,461
for the 20-odd months
before Chuck went off

1644
01:41:12,544 --> 01:41:14,546
to the University of Illinois.

1645
01:41:16,940 --> 01:41:20,161
They weren't able to be there
for the funeral, however.

1646
01:41:21,684 --> 01:41:24,212
It happened fast,
as Albie had wanted,

1647
01:41:24,295 --> 01:41:26,258
and his mom's folks
had loose ends

1648
01:41:26,341 --> 01:41:28,125
to tie up in Omaha.

1649
01:41:29,344 --> 01:41:31,911
Chuck didn't really miss
them, if he was honest.

1650
01:41:32,912 --> 01:41:35,006
His Zaydee hated a fuss

1651
01:41:35,089 --> 01:41:37,352
almost as much as
he hated a crowd.

1652
01:41:41,704 --> 01:41:44,406
A day before they were
scheduled to arrive,

1653
01:41:44,489 --> 01:41:46,843
Chuck finally
opened the envelope

1654
01:41:46,926 --> 01:41:48,584
that had been
sitting on the table

1655
01:41:48,667 --> 01:41:49,755
in the front hall.

1656
01:41:51,192 --> 01:41:53,807
It was from Sam Yarborough,

1657
01:41:53,890 --> 01:41:57,898
owner and chief undertaker
at Yarborough Funeral Home,

1658
01:41:57,981 --> 01:42:02,290
and inside were Albie
Krantz's personal effects.

1659
01:43:59,015 --> 01:44:01,717
In this room, Chuck's
grandpa had seen

1660
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:03,110
the Jefferies boy,

1661
01:44:03,193 --> 01:44:05,239
body broken by the car.

1662
01:44:07,023 --> 01:44:09,982
He'd seen Henry Peterson
hanging from the ceiling.

1663
01:44:11,245 --> 01:44:13,943
He'd seen his own
wife lying dead.

1664
01:44:14,378 --> 01:44:16,819
And likely, Chuck supposed,

1665
01:44:16,902 --> 01:44:20,079
perhaps the night Chuck
had stolen his keys,

1666
01:44:20,993 --> 01:44:25,263
Albie had even seen himself
crumpled to the floor,

1667
01:44:25,346 --> 01:44:27,348
still clutching his upper arm.

1668
01:44:28,914 --> 01:44:31,177
"It's the waiting," he'd said.

1669
01:44:32,570 --> 01:44:34,097
"That's the hard part."

1670
01:44:35,791 --> 01:44:38,228
Now Chuck's own
waiting would begin.

1671
01:44:39,969 --> 01:44:41,666
How long would that wait be?

1672
01:44:42,928 --> 01:44:46,588
Exactly how old was the
man in the hospital bed?

1673
01:44:51,981 --> 01:44:54,422
There was a final bip...

1674
01:44:54,505 --> 01:44:56,290
...from the unseen monitor

1675
01:44:57,203 --> 01:44:59,031
and then that was gone too.

1676
01:45:01,991 --> 01:45:03,779
The man did not fade,

1677
01:45:03,862 --> 01:45:06,735
as ghostly apparitions
did in the movies.

1678
01:45:07,649 --> 01:45:09,390
He was just gone.

1679
01:45:10,304 --> 01:45:13,481
Insisting he had never been
there in the first place.

1680
01:45:15,396 --> 01:45:17,223
-He wasn't...
-Chuck thinks.

1681
01:45:17,789 --> 01:45:19,400
...and I will insist he wasn't.

1682
01:45:20,879 --> 01:45:24,361
And I will live my life
until my life runs out.

1683
01:45:26,537 --> 01:45:27,756
I am wonderful.

1684
01:45:29,845 --> 01:45:31,368
I deserve to be wonderful.

1685
01:45:34,240 --> 01:45:36,112
